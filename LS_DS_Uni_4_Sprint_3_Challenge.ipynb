        "\n",
        "__*Your Answer:*__ A really prime example of an autoencoder would be image detection. Since autoencoders learn to ignore noise in data, an image recognition example would learn the bare minimum of what it needs to accurately detect an image. More clearly, take a super hi-res picture of a turtle. An autoencoder would essentially reduce the dimensionality of the data (make the image more pixelated), but only to the point where it can still recognize the image. SO our super hi-res image of the turtle would go into the auto encoder, and come out looking more like a pixelated picture from those old Ninja Turtles games on SNES."

        "Answer the following questions, with a target audience of a fellow Data Scientist:\n",
        "\n",
        "- What do you consider your strongest area, as a Data Scientist?\n",
        "  - My ability to learn quickly. There's no way to know everything, but being able to look things up and understand them is a valuable skill. Also, I consider my drive to _be_ a data scientist my strongest area. It's the underlying motivation for my ability to learn things quickly.\n",
        "- What area of Data Science would you most like to learn more about, and why?\n",
        "  - Good question. My curiosity draws me toward the research aspects of the field, but I also have a disdain for academia and want to put my skills to more applicable uses (maybe satiate my curiosity in the garage after work or something). Logistics has always interested me, and that's where I'd ultimately like to focus my energies. Amazon's donig some mindblowing stuff and FedEx has positioned themselves as major competitors. Logistics will only get more interesting in the coming years. Also, if we get hit with an EMP, or the robots take over, logistics will still be a valuable field of study. So long as there are people, there will be needs to fill, which requires logistics.\n",
        "- Where do you think Data Science will be in 5 years?\n",
        "  - Conversations will start being had among lawmakers similar to those they had in the early 2000s regarding accounting and GAAP. It's going to take an egregious act by some major company (doesn't have to be American, just has to scare the crap out of the American public - my money's on a Chinese company), but I believe that data scientists will soon need specific certifications, much like CPAs or lawyers, in order to practice. There will also be a set of geenerally accepted data principles that everyone must follow. I also believe that people will have to obtain certain levels of ecurity clearance to use certain types of neural networks as governments race to obtain better technologies and more data.\n",
        "- What are the threats posed by AI to our society?\n",
        "  - AI will be this generation's cold war nuclear arms race. The biggest threat is AI's ability to make us indifferent to war.\n",
        "- How do you think we can counteract those threats? \n",
        "  - Aside from cultural and/or spiritual revolution? Nothing can stop it. This won't be solved sitting in front of a computer screen.\n",
        "- Do you think achieving General Artifical Intelligence is ever possible?\n",
        "  - Humans will manage to destroy themselves with sub-human level algorithms long before AGI is achieved, so no.\n",
        "\n",
        "A few sentences per answer is fine - only elaborate if time allows."
