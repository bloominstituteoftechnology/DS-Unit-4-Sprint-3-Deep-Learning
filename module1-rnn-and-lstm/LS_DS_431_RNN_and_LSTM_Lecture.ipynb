This link will serve as our main resouce for understanding how LSTMs work. \n",

    "#### Forget Gate\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "$$f_t = \\sigma(W_f \\cdot [h_{t-1},x_t]~+~b_f)$$\n",

    "This neuron's job is to use the current input to learn what new information to include in the cell state. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "$$i_t = \\sigma(W_i \\cdot [h_{t-1},x_t]~+~b_i)$$\n",

    "- If $i_t$'s value is closer to 1.0, then more information from the candidate cell state is retained. \n",

    "It is $C_t$ that will be passed into the next training step and used by the output to make a final prediction. \n",

    "A Bidirectional LSTM, or biLSTM, is a sequence processing model that consists of two LSTMs: **one taking the input in a forward direction**, and **the other in a backwards direction**. BiLSTMs effectively increase the amount of information available to the network, improving the context available to the algorithm (e.g. knowing what words immediately follow and precede a word in a sentence).\n",
