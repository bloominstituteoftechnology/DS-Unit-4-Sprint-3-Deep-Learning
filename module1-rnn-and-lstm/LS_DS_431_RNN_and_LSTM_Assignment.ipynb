Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\\r\\n\\r\\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\\r\\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\\r\\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It exists\\r\\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\\r\\npeople in all walks of life.\\r\\n\\r\\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\\r\\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tmâ\\x80\\x99s\\r\\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will remain\\r\\nfreely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project Gutenberg\\r\\nLiterary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure and\\r\\npermanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations. To\\r\\nlearn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and\\r\\nhow your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4 and the\\r\\nFoundation information page at www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information\\r\\nabout the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\\r\\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the state\\r\\nof Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal Revenue\\r\\nService. The Foundationâ\\x80\\x99s EIN or federal tax identification number is\\r\\n64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\\r\\nFoundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by U.S.\\r\\nfederal laws and your stateâ\\x80\\x99s laws.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Foundationâ\\x80\\x99s principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the\\r\\nmailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its volunteers\\r\\nand employees are scattered throughout numerous locations. Its business\\r\\noffice is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt Lake City, UT 84116,\\r\\n(801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to date contact information\\r\\ncan be found at the Foundationâ\\x80\\x99s web site and official page at\\r\\nwww.gutenberg.org/contact\\r\\n\\r\\nFor additional contact information:\\r\\n\\r\\n    Dr. Gregory B. Newby Chief Executive and Director gbnewby@pglaf.org\\r\\n\\r\\nSection 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\\r\\nArchive Foundation\\r\\n\\r\\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide spread\\r\\npublic support and donations to carry out its mission of increasing the\\r\\nnumber of public domain and licensed works that can be freely\\r\\ndistributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest array of\\r\\nequipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations ($1 to\\r\\n$5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt status with\\r\\nthe IRS.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\\r\\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\\r\\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\\r\\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\\r\\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations where\\r\\nwe have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\\r\\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state\\r\\nvisit www.gutenberg.org/donate\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\\r\\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\\r\\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\\r\\napproach us with offers to donate.\\r\\n\\r\\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make any\\r\\nstatements concerning tax treatment of donations received from outside\\r\\nthe United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\\r\\n\\r\\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\\r\\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other ways\\r\\nincluding checks, online payments and credit card donations. To donate,\\r\\nplease visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate\\r\\n\\r\\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\\r\\nworks.\\r\\n\\r\\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\\r\\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\\r\\nwith anyone. For forty years, he produced and distributed Project\\r\\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\\r\\n\\r\\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\\r\\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\\r\\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\\r\\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\\r\\n\\r\\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\\r\\nwww.gutenberg.org\\r\\n\\r\\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm, including\\r\\nhow to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\\r\\nFoundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to subscribe to\\r\\nour email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n'"
