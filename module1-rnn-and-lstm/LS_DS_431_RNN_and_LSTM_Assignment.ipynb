desire increase That thereby beautys rose might never die But as the riper should by time decease His tender heir might bear his memory But thou contracted to thine own bright eyes Feedst thy lights flame with selfsubstantial fuel Making a famine where abundance lies Thy self thy foe to thy sweet self too cruel Thou that art now the worlds fresh ornament And only herald to the gaudy spring Within thine own bud buriest thy content And tender churl makst waste in niggarding   Pity the world or else this glutton be   To eat the worlds due by the grave and thee                         When forty winters shall besiege thy brow And dig deep trenches in thy beautys field Thy youths proud livery so gazed on now Will be a tattered weed of small worth held Then being asked where all thy beauty lies Where all the treasure of thy lusty days To say within thine own deep sunken eyes Were an alleating shame and thriftless praise How much more praise deservd thy beautys use If thou couldst answer This fair child of mine Shall sum my count and make my old excuse Proving his beauty by succession thine   This were to be new made when thou art old   And see thy blood warm when thou feelst it cold                         Look in thy glass and tell the face thou viewest Now is the time that face should form another Whose fresh repair if now thou not renewest Thou dost beguile the world unbless some mother For where is she so fair whose uneared womb Disdains the tillage of thy husbandry Or who is he so fond will be the tomb Of his selflove to stop posterity Thou art thy mothers glass and she in thee Calls back the lovely April of her prime So thou through windows of thine age shalt see Despite of wrinkles this thy golden time   But if thou live remembered not to be   Die single and thine image dies with thee                         Unthrifty loveliness why dost thou spend Upon thy self thy beautys legacy Natures bequest gives nothing but doth lend And being frank she lends to those are free Then beauteous niggard why dost thou abuse The bounteous largess given thee to give Profitless usurer why dost thou use So great a sum of sums yet canst not live For having traffic with thy self alone Thou of thy self thy sweet self dost deceive Then how when nature calls thee to be gone What acceptable audit canst thou leave   Thy unused beauty must be tombed with thee   Which used lives th executor to be                         Those hours that with gentle work did frame The lovely gaze where every eye doth dwell Will play the tyrants to the very same And that unfair which fairly doth excel For neverresting time leads summer on To hideous winter and confounds him there Sap checked with frost and lusty leaves quite gone Beauty oersnowed and bareness every where Then were not summers distillation left A liquid prisoner pent in walls of glass Beautys effect with beauty were bereft Nor it nor no remembrance what it was   But flowers distilled though they with winter meet   Leese but their show their substance still lives sweet                         Then let not winters ragged hand deface In thee thy summer ere thou be distilled Make sweet some vial treasure thou some place With beautys treasure ere it be selfkilled That use is not forbidden usury Which happies those that pay the willing loan Thats for thy self to breed another thee Or ten times happier be it ten for one Ten times thy self were happier than thou art If ten of thine ten times refigured thee Then what could death do if thou shouldst depart Leaving thee living in posterity   Be not selfwilled for thou art much too fair   To be deaths conquest and make worms thine heir                         Lo in the orient when the gracious light Lifts up his burning head each under eye Doth homage to his newappearing sight Serving with looks his sacred majesty And having climbed the steepup heavenly hill Resembling strong youth in his middle age Yet mortal looks adore his beauty still Attending on his golden pilgrimage But when from highmost pitch with weary car Like feeble age he reeleth from the day The eyes fore duteous now converted are From his low tract and look another way   So thou thy self outgoing in thy noon   Unlooked on diest unless thou get a son                         Music to hear why hearst thou music sadly Sweets with sweets war not joy delights in joy Why lovst thou that which thou receivst not gladly Or else receivst with pleasure thine annoy If the true concord of welltuned sounds By unions married do offend thine ear They do but sweetly chide thee who confounds In singleness the parts that thou shouldst bear Mark how one string sweet husband to another Strikes each in each by mutual ordering Resembling sire and child and happy mother Who all in one one pleasing note do sing   Whose speechless song being many seeming one   Sings this to thee Thou single wilt prove none                         Is it for fear to wet a widows eye That thou consumst thy self in single life Ah if thou issueless shalt hap to die The world will wail thee like a makeless wife The world will be thy widow and still weep That thou no form of thee hast left behind When every private widow well may keep By childrens eyes her husbands shape in mind Look what an unthrift in the world doth spend Shifts but his place for still the world enjoys it But beautys waste hath in the world an end And kept unused the user so destroys it   No love toward others in that bosom sits   That on himself such murdrous shame commits                         For shame deny that thou bearst love to any Who for thy self art so unprovident Grant if thou wilt thou art beloved of many But that thou none lovst is most evident For thou art so possessed with murdrous hate That gainst thy self thou stickst not to conspire Seeking that beauteous roof to ruinate Which to repair should be thy chief desire O change thy thought that I may change my mind Shall hate be fairer lodged than gentle love Be as thy presence is gracious and kind Or to thy self at least kindhearted prove   Make thee another self for love of me   That beauty still may live in thine or thee                         As fast as thou shalt wane so fast thou growst In one of thine from that which thou departest And that fresh blood which youngly thou bestowst Thou mayst call thine when thou from youth convertest Herein lives wisdom beauty and increase Without this folly age and cold decay If all were minded so the times should cease And threescore year would make the world away Let those whom nature hath not made for store Harsh featureless and rude barrenly perish Look whom she best endowed she gave thee more Which bounteous gift thou shouldst in bounty cherish   She carved thee for her seal and meant thereby   Thou shouldst print more not let that copy die                         When I do count the clock that tells the time And see the brave day sunk in hideous night When I behold the violet past prime And sable curls all silvered oer with white When lofty trees I see barren of leaves Which erst from heat did canopy the herd And summers green all girded up in sheaves Borne on the bier with white and bristly beard Then of thy beauty do I question make That thou among the wastes of time must go Since sweets and beauties do themselves forsake And die as fast as they see others grow   And nothing gainst Times scythe can make defence   Save breed to brave him when he takes thee hence                         O that you were your self but love you are No longer yours than you your self here live Against this coming end you should prepare And your sweet semblance to some other give So should that beauty which you hold in lease Find no determination then you were Your self again after your selfs decease When your sweet issue your sweet form should bear Who lets so fair a house fall to decay Which husbandry in honour might uphold Against the stormy gusts of winters day And barren rage of deaths eternal cold   O none but unthrifts dear my love you know   You had a father let your son say so                         Not from the stars do I my judgement pluck And yet methinks I have astronomy But not to tell of good or evil luck Of plagues of dearths or seasons quality Nor can I fortune to brief minutes tell Pointing to each his thunder rain and wind Or say with princes if it shall go well By oft predict that I in heaven find But from thine eyes my knowledge I derive And constant stars in them I read such art As truth and beauty shall together thrive If from thy self to store thou wouldst convert   Or else of thee this I prognosticate   Thy end is truths and beautys doom and date                         When I consider every thing that grows Holds in perfection but a little moment That this huge stage presenteth nought but shows Whereon the stars in secret influence comment When I perceive that men as plants increase Cheered and checked even by the selfsame sky Vaunt in their youthful sap at height decrease And wear their brave state out of memory Then the conceit of this inconstant stay Sets you most rich in youth before my sight Where wasteful time debateth with decay To change your day of youth to sullied night   And all in war with Time for love of you   As he takes from you I engraft you new                         But wherefore do not you a mightier way Make war upon this bloody tyrant Time And fortify your self in your decay With means more blessed than my barren rhyme Now stand you on the top of happy hours And many maiden gardens yet unset With virtuous wish would bear you living flowers Much liker than your painted counterfeit So should the lines of life that life repair Which this Times pencil or my pupil pen Neither in inward worth nor outward fair Can make you live your self in eyes of men   To give away your self keeps your self still   And you must live drawn by your own sweet skill                         Who will believe my verse in time to come If it were filled with your most high deserts Though yet heaven knows it is but as a tomb Which hides your life and shows not half your parts If I could write the beauty of your eyes And in fresh numbers number all your graces The age to come would say this poet lies Such heavenly touches neer touched earthly faces So should my papers yellowed with their age Be scorned like old men of less truth than tongue And your true rights be termed a poets rage And stretched metre of an antique song   But were some child of yours alive that time   You should live twice in it and in my rhyme                         Shall I compare thee to a summers day Thou art more lovely and more temperate Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May And summers lease hath all too short a date Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines And often is his gold complexion dimmed And every fair from fair sometime declines By chance or natures changing course untrimmed But thy eternal summer shall not fade Nor lose possession of that fair thou owst Nor shall death brag thou wandrest in his shade When in eternal lines to time thou growst   So long as men can breathe or eyes can see   So long lives this and this gives life to thee                         Devouring Time blunt thou the lions paws And make the earth devour her own sweet brood Pluck the keen teeth from the fierce tigers jaws And burn the longlived phoenix in her blood Make glad and sorry seasons as thou fleetst And do whateer thou wilt swiftfooted Time To the wide world and all her fading sweets But I forbid thee one most heinous crime O carve not with thy hours my loves fair brow Nor draw no lines there with thine antique pen Him in thy course untainted do allow For beautys pattern to succeeding men   Yet do thy worst old Time despite thy wrong   My love shall in my verse ever live young                         A womans face with natures own hand painted Hast thou the master mistress of my passion A womans gentle heart but not acquainted With shifting change as is false womens fashion An eye more bright than theirs less false in rolling Gilding the object whereupon it gazeth A man in hue all hues in his controlling Which steals mens eyes and womens souls amazeth And for a woman wert thou first created Till nature as she wrought thee fell adoting And by addition me of thee defeated By adding one thing to my purpose nothing   But since she pricked thee out for womens pleasure   Mine be thy love and thy loves use their treasure                         So is it not with me as with that muse Stirred by a painted beauty to his verse Who heaven it self for ornament doth use And every fair with his fair doth rehearse Making a couplement of proud compare With sun and moon with earth and seas rich gems With Aprils firstborn flowers and all things rare That heavens air in this huge rondure hems O let me true in love but truly write And then believe me my love is as fair As any mothers child though not so bright As those gold candles fixed in heavens air   Let them say more that like of hearsay well   I will not praise that purpose not to sell                         My glass shall not persuade me I am old So long as youth and thou are of one date But when in thee times furrows I behold Then look I death my days should expiate For all that beauty that doth cover thee Is but the seemly raiment of my heart Which in thy breast doth live as thine in me How can I then be elder than thou art O therefore love be of thyself so wary As I not for my self but for thee will Bearing thy heart which I will keep so chary As tender nurse her babe from faring ill   Presume not on thy heart when mine is slain   Thou gavst me thine not to give back again                         As an unperfect actor on the stage Who with his fear is put beside his part Or some fierce thing replete with too much rage Whose strengths abundance weakens his own heart So I for fear of trust forget to say The perfect ceremony of loves rite And in mine own loves strength seem to decay Oercharged with burthen of mine own loves might O let my looks be then the eloquence And dumb presagers of my speaking breast Who plead for love and look for recompense More than that tongue that more hath more expressed   O learn to read what silent love hath writ   To hear with eyes belongs to loves fine wit                         Mine eye hath played the painter and hath stelled Thy beautys form in table of my heart My body is the frame wherein tis held And perspective it is best painters art For through the painter must you see his skill To find where your true image pictured lies Which in my bosoms shop is hanging still That hath his windows glazed with thine eyes Now see what good turns eyes for eyes have done Mine eyes have drawn thy shape and thine for me Are windows to my breast wherethrough the sun Delights to peep to gaze therein on thee   Yet eyes this cunning want to grace their art   They draw but what they see know not the heart                         Let those who are in favour with their stars Of public honour and proud titles boast Whilst I whom fortune of such triumph bars Unlooked for joy in that I honour most Great princes favourites their fair leaves spread But as the marigold at the suns eye And in themselves their pride lies buried For at a frown they in their glory die The painful warrior famoused for fight After a thousand victories once foiled Is from the book of honour razed quite And all the rest forgot for which he toiled   Then happy I that love and am beloved   Where I may not remove nor be removed                         Lord of my love to whom in vassalage Thy merit hath my duty strongly knit To thee I send this written embassage To witness duty not to show my wit Duty so great which wit so poor as mine May make seem bare in wanting words to show it But that I hope some good conceit of thine In thy souls thought all naked will bestow it Till whatsoever star that guides my moving Points on me graciously with fair aspect And puts apparel on my tattered loving To show me worthy of thy sweet respect   Then may I dare to boast how I do love thee   Till then not show my head where thou mayst prove me                         Weary with toil I haste me to my bed The dear respose for limbs with travel tired But then begins a journey in my head To work my mind when bodys works expired For then my thoughts from far where I abide Intend a zealous pilgrimage to thee And keep my drooping eyelids open wide Looking on darkness which the blind do see Save that my souls imaginary sight Presents thy shadow to my sightless view Which like a jewel hung in ghastly night Makes black night beauteous and her old face new   Lo thus by day my limbs by night my mind   For thee and for my self no quiet find                         How can I then return in happy plight That am debarred the benefit of rest When days oppression is not eased by night But day by night and night by day oppressed And each though enemies to eithers reign Do in consent shake hands to torture me The one by toil the other to complain How far I toil still farther off from thee I tell the day to please him thou art bright And dost him grace when clouds do blot the heaven So flatter I the swartcomplexioned night When sparkling stars twire not thou gildst the even   But day doth daily draw my sorrows longer   And night doth nightly make griefs length seem stronger                         When in disgrace with Fortune and mens eyes I all alone beweep my outcast state And trouble deaf heaven with my bootless cries And look upon my self and curse my fate Wishing me like to one more rich in hope Featured like him like him with friends possessed Desiring this mans art and that mans scope With what I most enjoy contented least Yet in these thoughts my self almost despising Haply I think on thee and then my state Like to the lark at break of day arising From sullen earth sings hymns at heavens gate   For thy sweet love remembered such wealth brings   That then I scorn to change my state with kings                         When to the sessions of sweet silent thought I summon up remembrance of things past I sigh the lack of many a thing I sought And with old woes new wail my dear times waste Then can I drown an eye unused to flow For precious friends hid in deaths dateless night And weep afresh loves long since cancelled woe And moan th expense of many a vanished sight Then can I grieve at grievances foregone And heavily from woe to woe tell oer The sad account of forebemoaned moan Which I new pay as if not paid before   But if the while I think on thee dear friend   All losses are restored and sorrows end                         Thy bosom is endeared with all hearts Which I by lacking have supposed dead And there reigns love and all loves loving parts And all those friends which I thought buried How many a holy and obsequious tear Hath dear religious love stoln from mine eye As interest of the dead which now appear But things removed that hidden in thee lie Thou art the grave where buried love doth live Hung with the trophies of my lovers gone Who all their parts of me to thee did give That due of many now is thine alone   Their images I loved I view in thee   And thou all they hast all the all of me                         If thou survive my wellcontented day When that churl death my bones with dust shall cover And shalt by fortune once more resurvey These poor rude lines of thy deceased lover Compare them with the bettring of the time And though they be outstripped by every pen Reserve them for my love not for their rhyme Exceeded by the height of happier men O then vouchsafe me but this loving thought Had my friends Muse grown with this growing age A dearer birth than this his love had brought To march in ranks of better equipage   But since he died and poets better prove   Theirs for their style Ill read his for his love                         Full many a glorious morning have I seen Flatter the mountain tops with sovereign eye Kissing with golden face the meadows green Gilding pale streams with heavenly alchemy Anon permit the basest clouds to ride With ugly rack on his celestial face And from the forlorn world his visage hide Stealing unseen to west with this disgrace Even so my sun one early morn did shine With all triumphant splendour on my brow But out alack he was but one hour mine The region cloud hath masked him from me now   Yet him for this my love no whit disdaineth   Suns of the world may stain when heavens sun staineth                         Why didst thou promise such a beauteous day And make me travel forth without my cloak To let base clouds oertake me in my way Hiding thy bravry in their rotten smoke Tis not enough that through the cloud thou break To dry the rain on my stormbeaten face For no man well of such a salve can speak That heals the wound and cures not the disgrace Nor can thy shame give physic to my grief Though thou repent yet I have still the loss Th offenders sorrow lends but weak relief To him that bears the strong offences cross   Ah but those tears are pearl which thy love sheds   And they are rich and ransom all ill deeds                         No more be grieved at that which thou hast done Roses have thorns and silver fountains mud Clouds and eclipses stain both moon and sun And loathsome canker lives in sweetest bud All men make faults and even I in this Authorizing thy trespass with compare My self corrupting salving thy amiss Excusing thy sins more than thy sins are For to thy sensual fault I bring in sense Thy adverse party is thy advocate And gainst my self a lawful plea commence Such civil war is in my love and hate   That I an accessary needs must be   To that sweet thief which sourly robs from me                         Let me confess that we two must be twain Although our undivided loves are one So shall those blots that do with me remain Without thy help by me be borne alone In our two loves there is but one respect Though in our lives a separable spite Which though it alter not loves sole effect Yet doth it steal sweet hours from loves delight I may not evermore acknowledge thee Lest my bewailed guilt should do thee shame Nor thou with public kindness honour me Unless thou take that honour from thy name   But do not so I love thee in such sort   As thou being mine mine is thy good report                         As a decrepit father takes delight To see his active child do deeds of youth So I made lame by Fortunes dearest spite Take all my comfort of thy worth and truth For whether beauty birth or wealth or wit Or any of these all or all or more Entitled in thy parts do crowned sit I make my love engrafted to this store So then I am not lame poor nor despised Whilst that this shadow doth such substance give That I in thy abundance am sufficed And by a part of all thy glory live   Look what is best that best I wish in thee   This wish I have then ten times happy me                         How can my muse want subject to invent While thou dost breathe that pourst into my verse Thine own sweet argument too excellent For every vulgar paper to rehearse O give thy self the thanks if aught in me Worthy perusal stand against thy sight For whos so dumb that cannot write to thee When thou thy self dost give invention light Be thou the tenth Muse ten times more in worth Than those old nine which rhymers invocate And he that calls on thee let him bring forth Eternal numbers to outlive long date   If my slight muse do please these curious days   The pain be mine but thine shall be the praise                         O how thy worth with manners may I sing When thou art all the better part of me What can mine own praise to mine own self bring And what ist but mine own when I praise thee Even for this let us divided live And our dear love lose name of single one That by this separation I may give That due to thee which thou deservst alone O absence what a torment wouldst thou prove Were it not thy sour leisure gave sweet leave To entertain the time with thoughts of love Which time and thoughts so sweetly doth deceive   And that thou teachest how to make one twain   By praising him here who doth hence remain                         Take all my loves my love yea take them all What hast thou then more than thou hadst before No love my love that thou mayst true love call All mine was thine before thou hadst this more Then if for my love thou my love receivest I cannot blame thee for my love thou usest But yet be blamed if thou thy self deceivest By wilful taste of what thy self refusest I do forgive thy robbery gentle thief Although thou steal thee all my poverty And yet love knows it is a greater grief To bear greater wrong than hates known injury   Lascivious grace in whom all ill well shows   Kill me with spites yet we must not be foes                         Those pretty wrongs that liberty commits When I am sometime absent from thy heart Thy beauty and thy years full well befits For still temptation follows where thou art Gentle thou art and therefore to be won Beauteous thou art therefore to be assailed And when a woman woos what womans son Will sourly leave her till he have prevailed Ay me but yet thou mightst my seat forbear And chide thy beauty and thy straying youth Who lead thee in their riot even there Where thou art forced to break a twofold truth   Hers by thy beauty tempting her to thee   Thine by thy beauty being false to me                         That thou hast her it is not all my grief And yet it may be said I loved her dearly That she hath thee is of my wailing chief A loss in love that touches me more nearly Loving offenders thus I will excuse ye Thou dost love her because thou knowst I love her And for my sake even so doth she abuse me Suffring my friend for my sake to approve her If I lose thee my loss is my loves gain And losing her my friend hath found that loss Both find each other and I lose both twain And both for my sake lay on me this cross   But heres the joy my friend and I are one   Sweet flattery then she loves but me alone                         When most I wink then do mine eyes best see For all the day they view things unrespected But when I sleep in dreams they look on thee And darkly bright are bright in dark directed Then thou whose shadow shadows doth make bright How would thy shadows form form happy show To the clear day with thy much clearer light When to unseeing eyes thy shade shines so How would I say mine eyes be blessed made By looking on thee in the living day When in dead night thy fair imperfect shade Through heavy sleep on sightless eyes doth stay   All days are nights to see till I see thee   And nights bright days when dreams do show thee me                         If the dull substance of my flesh were thought Injurious distance should not stop my way For then despite of space I would be brought From limits far remote where thou dost stay No matter then although my foot did stand Upon the farthest earth removed from thee For nimble thought can jump both sea and land As soon as think the place where he would be But ah thought kills me that I am not thought To leap large lengths of miles when thou art gone But that so much of earth and water wrought I must attend times leisure with my moan   Receiving nought by elements so slow   But heavy tears badges of eithers woe                         The other two slight air and purging fire Are both with thee wherever I abide The first my thought the other my desire These presentabsent with swift motion slide For when these quicker elements are gone In tender embassy of love to thee My life being made of four with two alone Sinks down to death oppressed with melancholy Until lifes composition be recured By those swift messengers returned from thee Who even but now come back again assured Of thy fair health recounting it to me   This told I joy but then no longer glad   I send them back again and straight grow sad                         Mine eye and heart are at a mortal war How to divide the conquest of thy sight Mine eye my heart thy pictures sight would bar My heart mine eye the freedom of that right My heart doth plead that thou in him dost lie A closet never pierced with crystal eyes But the defendant doth that plea deny And says in him thy fair appearance lies To side this title is impanelled A quest of thoughts all tenants to the heart And by their verdict is determined The clear eyes moiety and the dear hearts part   As thus mine eyes due is thy outward part   And my hearts right thy inward love of heart                         Betwixt mine eye and heart a league is took And each doth good turns now unto the other When that mine eye is famished for a look Or heart in love with sighs himself doth smother With my loves picture then my eye doth feast And to the painted banquet bids my heart Another time mine eye is my hearts guest And in his thoughts of love doth share a part So either by thy picture or my love Thy self away art present still with me For thou not farther than my thoughts canst move And I am still with them and they with thee   Or if they sleep thy picture in my sight   Awakes my heart to hearts and eyes delight                         How careful was I when I took my way Each trifle under truest bars to thrust That to my use it might unused stay From hands of falsehood in sure wards of trust But thou to whom my jewels trifles are Most worthy comfort now my greatest grief Thou best of dearest and mine only care Art left the prey of every vulgar thief Thee have I not locked up in any chest Save where thou art not though I feel thou art Within the gentle closure of my breast From whence at pleasure thou mayst come and part   And even thence thou wilt be stoln I fear   For truth proves thievish for a prize so dear                         Against that time if ever that time come When I shall see thee frown on my defects When as thy love hath cast his utmost sum Called to that audit by advised respects Against that time when thou shalt strangely pass And scarcely greet me with that sun thine eye When love converted from the thing it was Shall reasons find of settled gravity Against that time do I ensconce me here Within the knowledge of mine own desert And this my hand against my self uprear To guard the lawful reasons on thy part   To leave poor me thou hast the strength of laws   Since why to love I can allege no cause                         How heavy do I journey on the way When what I seek my weary travels end Doth teach that case and that repose to say Thus far the miles are measured from thy friend The beast that bears me tired with my woe Plods dully on to bear that weight in me As if by some instinct the wretch did know His rider loved not speed being made from thee The bloody spur cannot provoke him on That sometimes anger thrusts into his hide Which heavily he answers with a groan More sharp to me than spurring to his side   For that same groan doth put this in my mind   My grief lies onward and my joy behind                         Thus can my love excuse the slow offence Of my dull bearer when from thee I speed From where thou art why should I haste me thence Till I return of posting is no need O what excuse will my poor beast then find When swift extremity can seem but slow Then should I spur though mounted on the wind In winged speed no motion shall I know Then can no horse with my desire keep pace Therefore desire of perfectst love being made Shall neigh no dull flesh in his fiery race But love for love thus shall excuse my jade   Since from thee going he went wilfulslow   Towards thee Ill run and give him leave to go                         So am I as the rich whose blessed key Can bring him to his sweet uplocked treasure The which he will not every hour survey For blunting the fine point of seldom pleasure Therefore are feasts so solemn and so rare Since seldom coming in that long year set Like stones of worth they thinly placed are Or captain jewels in the carcanet So is the time that keeps you as my chest Or as the wardrobe which the robe doth hide To make some special instant specialblest By new unfolding his imprisoned pride   Blessed are you whose worthiness gives scope   Being had to triumph being lacked to hope                         What is your substance whereof are you made That millions of strange shadows on you tend Since every one hath every one one shade And you but one can every shadow lend Describe Adonis and the counterfeit Is poorly imitated after you On Helens cheek all art of beauty set And you in Grecian tires are painted new Speak of the spring and foison of the year The one doth shadow of your beauty show The other as your bounty doth appear And you in every blessed shape we know   In all external grace you have some part   But you like none none you for constant heart                         O how much more doth beauty beauteous seem By that sweet ornament which truth doth give The rose looks fair but fairer we it deem For that sweet odour which doth in it live The canker blooms have full as deep a dye As the perfumed tincture of the roses Hang on such thorns and play as wantonly When summers breath their masked buds discloses But for their virtue only is their show They live unwooed and unrespected fade Die to themselves Sweet roses do not so Of their sweet deaths are sweetest odours made   And so of you beauteous and lovely youth   When that shall fade my verse distills your truth                         Not marble nor the gilded monuments Of princes shall outlive this powerful rhyme But you shall shine more bright in these contents Than unswept stone besmeared with sluttish time When wasteful war shall statues overturn And broils root out the work of masonry Nor Mars his sword nor wars quick fire shall burn The living record of your memory Gainst death and alloblivious enmity Shall you pace forth your praise shall still find room Even in the eyes of all posterity That wear this world out to the ending doom   So till the judgment that your self arise   You live in this and dwell in lovers eyes                         Sweet love renew thy force be it not said Thy edge should blunter be than appetite Which but today by feeding is allayed Tomorrow sharpened in his former might So love be thou although today thou fill Thy hungry eyes even till they wink with fulness Tomorrow see again and do not kill The spirit of love with a perpetual dulness Let this sad interim like the ocean be Which parts the shore where two contracted new Come daily to the banks that when they see Return of love more blest may be the view   Or call it winter which being full of care   Makes summers welcome thrice more wished more rare                         Being your slave what should I do but tend Upon the hours and times of your desire I have no precious time at all to spend Nor services to do till you require Nor dare I chide the worldwithoutend hour Whilst I my sovereign watch the clock for you Nor think the bitterness of absence sour When you have bid your servant once adieu Nor dare I question with my jealous thought Where you may be or your affairs suppose But like a sad slave stay and think of nought Save where you are how happy you make those   So true a fool is love that in your will   Though you do any thing he thinks no ill                         That god forbid that made me first your slave I should in thought control your times of pleasure Or at your hand th account of hours to crave Being your vassal bound to stay your leisure O let me suffer being at your beck Th imprisoned absence of your liberty And patience tame to sufferance bide each check Without accusing you of injury Be where you list your charter is so strong That you your self may privilage your time To what you will to you it doth belong Your self to pardon of selfdoing crime   I am to wait though waiting so be hell   Not blame your pleasure be it ill or well                         If there be nothing new but that which is Hath been before how are our brains beguiled Which labouring for invention bear amis The second burthen of a former child O that record could with a backward look Even of five hundred courses of the sun Show me your image in some antique book Since mind at first in character was done That I might see what the old world could say To this composed wonder of your frame Whether we are mended or whether better they Or whether revolution be the same   O sure I am the wits of former days   To subjects worse have given admiring praise                         Like as the waves make towards the pebbled shore So do our minutes hasten to their end Each changing place with that which goes before In sequent toil all forwards do contend Nativity once in the main of light Crawls to maturity wherewith being crowned Crooked eclipses gainst his glory fight And Time that gave doth now his gift confound Time doth transfix the flourish set on youth And delves the parallels in beautys brow Feeds on the rarities of natures truth And nothing stands but for his scythe to mow   And yet to times in hope my verse shall stand   Praising thy worth despite his cruel hand                         Is it thy will thy image should keep open My heavy eyelids to the weary night Dost thou desire my slumbers should be broken While shadows like to thee do mock my sight Is it thy spirit that thou sendst from thee So far from home into my deeds to pry To find out shames and idle hours in me The scope and tenure of thy jealousy O no thy love though much is not so great It is my love that keeps mine eye awake Mine own true love that doth my rest defeat To play the watchman ever for thy sake   For thee watch I whilst thou dost wake elsewhere   From me far off with others all too near                         Sin of selflove possesseth all mine eye And all my soul and all my every part And for this sin there is no remedy It is so grounded inward in my heart Methinks no face so gracious is as mine No shape so true no truth of such account And for my self mine own worth do define As I all other in all worths surmount But when my glass shows me my self indeed beated and chopt with tanned antiquity Mine own selflove quite contrary I read Self so selfloving were iniquity   Tis thee my self that for my self I praise   Painting my age with beauty of thy days                         Against my love shall be as I am now With Times injurious hand crushed and oerworn When hours have drained his blood and filled his brow With lines and wrinkles when his youthful morn Hath travelled on to ages steepy night And all those beauties whereof now hes king Are vanishing or vanished out of sight Stealing away the treasure of his spring For such a time do I now fortify Against confounding ages cruel knife That he shall never cut from memory My sweet loves beauty though my lovers life   His beauty shall in these black lines be seen   And they shall live and he in them still green                         When I have seen by Times fell hand defaced The richproud cost of outworn buried age When sometime lofty towers I see downrased And brass eternal slave to mortal rage When I have seen the hungry ocean gain Advantage on the kingdom of the shore And the firm soil win of the watery main Increasing store with loss and loss with store When I have seen such interchange of State Or state it self confounded to decay Ruin hath taught me thus to ruminate That Time will come and take my love away   This thought is as a death which cannot choose   But weep to have that which it fears to lose                         Since brass nor stone nor earth nor boundless sea But sad mortality oersways their power How with this rage shall beauty hold a plea Whose action is no stronger than a flower O how shall summers honey breath hold out Against the wrackful siege of battring days When rocks impregnable are not so stout Nor gates of steel so strong but time decays O fearful meditation where alack Shall Times best jewel from Times chest lie hid Or what strong hand can hold his swift foot back Or who his spoil of beauty can forbid   O none unless this miracle have might   That in black ink my love may still shine bright                         Tired with all these for restful death I cry As to behold desert a beggar born And needy nothing trimmed in jollity And purest faith unhappily forsworn And gilded honour shamefully misplaced And maiden virtue rudely strumpeted And right perfection wrongfully disgraced And strength by limping sway disabled And art made tonguetied by authority And folly doctorlike controlling skill And simple truth miscalled simplicity And captive good attending captain ill   Tired with all these from these would I be gone   Save that to die I leave my love alone                         Ah wherefore with infection should he live And with his presence grace impiety That sin by him advantage should achieve And lace it self with his society Why should false painting imitate his cheek And steal dead seeming of his living hue Why should poor beauty indirectly seek Roses of shadow since his rose is true Why should he live now nature bankrupt is Beggared of blood to blush through lively veins For she hath no exchequer now but his And proud of many lives upon his gains   O him she stores to show what wealth she had   In days long since before these last so bad                         Thus is his cheek the map of days outworn When beauty lived and died as flowers do now Before these bastard signs of fair were born Or durst inhabit on a living brow Before the golden tresses of the dead The right of sepulchres were shorn away To live a second life on second head Ere beautys dead fleece made another gay In him those holy antique hours are seen Without all ornament it self and true Making no summer of anothers green Robbing no old to dress his beauty new   And him as for a map doth Nature store   To show false Art what beauty was of yore                         Those parts of thee that the worlds eye doth view Want nothing that the thought of hearts can mend All tongues the voice of souls give thee that due Uttering bare truth even so as foes commend Thy outward thus with outward praise is crowned But those same tongues that give thee so thine own In other accents do this praise confound By seeing farther than the eye hath shown They look into the beauty of thy mind And that in guess they measure by thy deeds Then churls their thoughts although their eyes were kind To thy fair flower add the rank smell of weeds   But why thy odour matcheth not thy show   The soil is this that thou dost common grow                         That thou art blamed shall not be thy defect For slanders mark was ever yet the fair The ornament of beauty is suspect A crow that flies in heavens sweetest air So thou be good slander doth but approve Thy worth the greater being wooed of time For canker vice the sweetest buds doth love And thou presentst a pure unstained prime Thou hast passed by the ambush of young days Either not assailed or victor being charged Yet this thy praise cannot be so thy praise To tie up envy evermore enlarged   If some suspect of ill masked not thy show   Then thou alone kingdoms of hearts shouldst owe                         No longer mourn for me when I am dead Than you shall hear the surly sullen bell Give warning to the world that I am fled From this vile world with vilest worms to dwell Nay if you read this line remember not The hand that writ it for I love you so That I in your sweet thoughts would be forgot If thinking on me then should make you woe O if I say you look upon this verse When I perhaps compounded am with clay Do not so much as my poor name rehearse But let your love even with my life decay   Lest the wise world should look into your moan   And mock you with me after I am gone                         O lest the world should task you to recite What merit lived in me that you should love After my death dear love forget me quite For you in me can nothing worthy prove Unless you would devise some virtuous lie To do more for me than mine own desert And hang more praise upon deceased I Than niggard truth would willingly impart O lest your true love may seem false in this That you for love speak well of me untrue My name be buried where my body is And live no more to shame nor me nor you   For I am shamed by that which I bring forth   And so should you to love things nothing worth                         That time of year thou mayst in me behold When yellow leaves or none or few do hang Upon those boughs which shake against the cold Bare ruined choirs where late the sweet birds sang In me thou seest the twilight of such day As after sunset fadeth in the west Which by and by black night doth take away Deaths second self that seals up all in rest In me thou seest the glowing of such fire That on the ashes of his youth doth lie As the deathbed whereon it must expire Consumed with that which it was nourished by   This thou perceivst which makes thy love more strong   To love that well which thou must leave ere long                         But be contented when that fell arrest Without all bail shall carry me away My life hath in this line some interest Which for memorial still with thee shall stay When thou reviewest this thou dost review The very part was consecrate to thee The earth can have but earth which is his due My spirit is thine the better part of me So then thou hast but lost the dregs of life The prey of worms my body being dead The coward conquest of a wretchs knife Too base of thee to be remembered   The worth of that is that which it contains   And that is this and this with thee remains                         So are you to my thoughts as food to life Or as sweetseasoned showers are to the ground And for the peace of you I hold such strife As twixt a miser and his wealth is found Now proud as an enjoyer and anon Doubting the filching age will steal his treasure Now counting best to be with you alone Then bettered that the world may see my pleasure Sometime all full with feasting on your sight And by and by clean starved for a look Possessing or pursuing no delight Save what is had or must from you be took   Thus do I pine and surfeit day by day   Or gluttoning on all or all away                         Why is my verse so barren of new pride So far from variation or quick change Why with the time do I not glance aside To newfound methods and to compounds strange Why write I still all one ever the same And keep invention in a noted weed That every word doth almost tell my name Showing their birth and where they did proceed O know sweet love I always write of you And you and love are still my argument So all my best is dressing old words new Spending again what is already spent   For as the sun is daily new and old   So is my love still telling what is told                         Thy glass will show thee how thy beauties wear Thy dial how thy precious minutes waste These vacant leaves thy minds imprint will bear And of this book this learning mayst thou taste The wrinkles which thy glass will truly show Of mouthed graves will give thee memory Thou by thy dials shady stealth mayst know Times thievish progress to eternity Look what thy memory cannot contain Commit to these waste blanks and thou shalt find Those children nursed delivered from thy brain To take a new acquaintance of thy mind   These offices so oft as thou wilt look   Shall profit thee and much enrich thy book                         So oft have I invoked thee for my muse And found such fair assistance in my verse As every alien pen hath got my use And under thee their poesy disperse Thine eyes that taught the dumb on high to sing And heavy ignorance aloft to fly Have added feathers to the learneds wing And given grace a double majesty Yet be most proud of that which I compile Whose influence is thine and born of thee In others works thou dost but mend the style And arts with thy sweet graces graced be   But thou art all my art and dost advance   As high as learning my rude ignorance                         Whilst I alone did call upon thy aid My verse alone had all thy gentle grace But now my gracious numbers are decayed And my sick muse doth give an other place I grant sweet love thy lovely argument Deserves the travail of a worthier pen Yet what of thee thy poet doth invent He robs thee of and pays it thee again He lends thee virtue and he stole that word From thy behaviour beauty doth he give And found it in thy cheek he can afford No praise to thee but what in thee doth live   Then thank him not for that which he doth say   Since what he owes thee thou thy self dost pay                         O how I faint when I of you do write Knowing a better spirit doth use your name And in the praise thereof spends all his might To make me tonguetied speaking of your fame But since your worth wide as the ocean is The humble as the proudest sail doth bear My saucy bark inferior far to his On your broad main doth wilfully appear Your shallowest help will hold me up afloat Whilst he upon your soundless deep doth ride Or being wrecked I am a worthless boat He of tall building and of goodly pride   Then if he thrive and I be cast away   The worst was this my love was my decay                         Or I shall live your epitaph to make Or you survive when I in earth am rotten From hence your memory death cannot take Although in me each part will be forgotten Your name from hence immortal life shall have Though I once gone to all the world must die The earth can yield me but a common grave When you entombed in mens eyes shall lie Your monument shall be my gentle verse Which eyes not yet created shall oerread And tongues to be your being shall rehearse When all the breathers of this world are dead   You still shall live such virtue hath my pen   Where breath most breathes even in the mouths of men                         I grant thou wert not married to my muse And therefore mayst without attaint oerlook The dedicated words which writers use Of their fair subject blessing every book Thou art as fair in knowledge as in hue Finding thy worth a limit past my praise And therefore art enforced to seek anew Some fresher stamp of the timebettering days And do so love yet when they have devised What strained touches rhetoric can lend Thou truly fair wert truly sympathized In true plain words by thy truetelling friend   And their gross painting might be better used   Where cheeks need blood in thee it is abused                         I never saw that you did painting need And therefore to your fair no painting set I found or thought I found you did exceed That barren tender of a poets debt And therefore have I slept in your report That you your self being extant well might show How far a modern quill doth come too short Speaking of worth what worth in you doth grow This silence for my sin you did impute Which shall be most my glory being dumb For I impair not beauty being mute When others would give life and bring a tomb   There lives more life in one of your fair eyes   Than both your poets can in praise devise                         Who is it that says most which can say more Than this rich praise that you alone are you In whose confine immured is the store Which should example where your equal grew Lean penury within that pen doth dwell That to his subject lends not some small glory But he that writes of you if he can tell That you are you so dignifies his story Let him but copy what in you is writ Not making worse what nature made so clear And such a counterpart shall fame his wit Making his style admired every where   You to your beauteous blessings add a curse   Being fond on praise which makes your praises worse                         My tonguetied muse in manners holds her still While comments of your praise richly compiled Reserve their character with golden quill And precious phrase by all the Muses filed I think good thoughts whilst other write good words And like unlettered clerk still cry Amen To every hymn that able spirit affords In polished form of well refined pen Hearing you praised I say tis so tis true And to the most of praise add something more But that is in my thought whose love to you Though words come hindmost holds his rank before   Then others for the breath of words respect   Me for my dumb thoughts speaking in effect                         Was it the proud full sail of his great verse Bound for the prize of all too precious you That did my ripe thoughts in my brain inhearse Making their tomb the womb wherein they grew Was it his spirit by spirits taught to write Above a mortal pitch that struck me dead No neither he nor his compeers by night Giving him aid my verse astonished He nor that affable familiar ghost Which nightly gulls him with intelligence As victors of my silence cannot boast I was not sick of any fear from thence   But when your countenance filled up his line   Then lacked I matter that enfeebled mine                         Farewell thou art too dear for my possessing And like enough thou knowst thy estimate The charter of thy worth gives thee releasing My bonds in thee are all determinate For how do I hold thee but by thy granting And for that riches where is my deserving The cause of this fair gift in me is wanting And so my patent back again is swerving Thy self thou gavst thy own worth then not knowing Or me to whom thou gavst it else mistaking So thy great gift upon misprision growing Comes home again on better judgement making   Thus have I had thee as a dream doth flatter   In sleep a king but waking no such matter                         When thou shalt be disposed to set me light And place my merit in the eye of scorn Upon thy side against my self Ill fight And prove thee virtuous though thou art forsworn With mine own weakness being best acquainted Upon thy part I can set down a story Of faults concealed wherein I am attainted That thou in losing me shalt win much glory And I by this will be a gainer too For bending all my loving thoughts on thee The injuries that to my self I do Doing thee vantage doublevantage me   Such is my love to thee I so belong   That for thy right my self will bear all wrong                         Say that thou didst forsake me for some fault And I will comment upon that offence Speak of my lameness and I straight will halt Against thy reasons making no defence Thou canst not love disgrace me half so ill To set a form upon desired change As Ill my self disgrace knowing thy will I will acquaintance strangle and look strange Be absent from thy walks and in my tongue Thy sweet beloved name no more shall dwell Lest I too much profane should do it wronk And haply of our old acquaintance tell   For thee against my self Ill vow debate   For I must neer love him whom thou dost hate                         Then hate me when thou wilt if ever now Now while the world is bent my deeds to cross join with the spite of fortune make me bow And do not drop in for an afterloss Ah do not when my heart hath scaped this sorrow Come in the rearward of a conquered woe Give not a windy night a rainy morrow To linger out a purposed overthrow If thou wilt leave me do not leave me last When other petty griefs have done their spite But in the onset come so shall I taste At first the very worst of fortunes might   And other strains of woe which now seem woe   Compared with loss of thee will not seem so                         Some glory in their birth some in their skill Some in their wealth some in their bodys force Some in their garments though newfangled ill Some in their hawks and hounds some in their horse And every humour hath his adjunct pleasure Wherein it finds a joy above the rest But these particulars are not my measure All these I better in one general best Thy love is better than high birth to me Richer than wealth prouder than garments costs Of more delight than hawks and horses be And having thee of all mens pride I boast   Wretched in this alone that thou mayst take   All this away and me most wretchcd make                         But do thy worst to steal thy self away For term of life thou art assured mine And life no longer than thy love will stay For it depends upon that love of thine Then need I not to fear the worst of wrongs When in the least of them my life hath end I see a better state to me belongs Than that which on thy humour doth depend Thou canst not vex me with inconstant mind Since that my life on thy revolt doth lie O what a happy title do I find Happy to have thy love happy to die   But whats so blessedfair that fears no blot   Thou mayst be false and yet I know it not                         So shall I live supposing thou art true Like a deceived husband so loves face May still seem love to me though altered new Thy looks with me thy heart in other place For there can live no hatred in thine eye Therefore in that I cannot know thy change In manys looks the false hearts history Is writ in moods and frowns and wrinkles strange But heaven in thy creation did decree That in thy face sweet love should ever dwell Whateer thy thoughts or thy hearts workings be Thy looks should nothing thence but sweetness tell   How like Eves apple doth thy beauty grow   If thy sweet virtue answer not thy show                         They that have power to hurt and will do none That do not do the thing they most do show Who moving others are themselves as stone Unmoved cold and to temptation slow They rightly do inherit heavens graces And husband natures riches from expense Tibey are the lords and owners of their faces Others but stewards of their excellence The summers flower is to the summer sweet Though to it self it only live and die But if that flower with base infection meet The basest weed outbraves his dignity   For sweetest things turn sourest by their deeds   Lilies that fester smell far worse than weeds                         How sweet and lovely dost thou make the shame Which like a canker in the fragrant rose Doth spot the beauty of thy budding name O in what sweets dost thou thy sins enclose That tongue that tells the story of thy days Making lascivious comments on thy sport Cannot dispraise but in a kind of praise Naming thy name blesses an ill report O what a mansion have those vices got Which for their habitation chose out thee Where beautys veil doth cover every blot And all things turns to fair that eyes can see   Take heed dear heart of this large privilege   The hardest knife illused doth lose his edge                         Some say thy fault is youth some wantonness Some say thy grace is youth and gentle sport Both grace and faults are loved of more and less Thou makst faults graces that to thee resort As on the finger of a throned queen The basest jewel will be well esteemed So are those errors that in thee are seen To truths translated and for true things deemed How many lambs might the stern wolf betray If like a lamb he could his looks translate How many gazers mightst thou lead away if thou wouldst use the strength of all thy state   But do not so I love thee in such sort   As thou being mine mine is thy good report                         How like a winter hath my absence been From thee the pleasure of the fleeting year What freezings have I felt what dark days seen What old Decembers bareness everywhere And yet this time removed was summers time The teeming autumn big with rich increase Bearing the wanton burden of the prime Like widowed wombs after their lords decease Yet this abundant issue seemed to me But hope of orphans and unfathered fruit For summer and his pleasures wait on thee And thou away the very birds are mute   Or if they sing tis with so dull a cheer   That leaves look pale dreading the winters near                         From you have I been absent in the spring When proudpied April dressed in all his trim Hath put a spirit of youth in every thing That heavy Saturn laughed and leaped with him Yet nor the lays of birds nor the sweet smell Of different flowers in odour and in hue Could make me any summers story tell Or from their proud lap pluck them where they grew Nor did I wonder at the lilys white Nor praise the deep vermilion in the rose They were but sweet but figures of delight Drawn after you you pattern of all those   Yet seemed it winter still and you away   As with your shadow I with these did play                         The forward violet thus did I chide Sweet thief whence didst thou steal thy sweet that smells If not from my loves breath The purple pride Which on thy soft check for complexion dwells In my loves veins thou hast too grossly dyed The lily I condemned for thy hand And buds of marjoram had stoln thy hair The roses fearfully on thorns did stand One blushing shame another white despair A third nor red nor white had stoln of both And to his robbery had annexed thy breath But for his theft in pride of all his growth A vengeful canker eat him up to death   More flowers I noted yet I none could see   But sweet or colour it had stoln from thee                         Where art thou Muse that thou forgetst so long To speak of that which gives thee all thy might Spendst thou thy fury on some worthless song Darkening thy power to lend base subjects light Return forgetful Muse and straight redeem In gentle numbers time so idly spent Sing to the ear that doth thy lays esteem And gives thy pen both skill and argument Rise resty Muse my loves sweet face survey If time have any wrinkle graven there If any be a satire to decay And make times spoils despised everywhere   Give my love fame faster than Time wastes life   So thou preventst his scythe and crooked knife                         O truant Muse what shall be thy amends For thy neglect of truth in beauty dyed Both truth and beauty on my love depends So dost thou too and therein dignified Make answer Muse wilt thou not haply say Truth needs no colour with his colour fixed Beauty no pencil beautys truth to lay But best is best if never intermixed Because he needs no praise wilt thou be dumb Excuse not silence so fort lies in thee To make him much outlive a gilded tomb And to be praised of ages yet to be   Then do thy office Muse I teach thee how   To make him seem long hence as he shows now                         My love is strengthened though more weak in seeming I love not less though less the show appear That love is merchandized whose rich esteeming The owners tongue doth publish every where Our love was new and then but in the spring When I was wont to greet it with my lays As Philomel in summers front doth sing And stops her pipe in growth of riper days Not that the summer is less pleasant now Than when her mournful hymns did hush the night But that wild music burthens every bough And sweets grown common lose their dear delight   Therefore like her I sometime hold my tongue   Because I would not dull you with my song                         Alack what poverty my muse brings forth That having such a scope to show her pride The argument all bare is of more worth Than when it hath my added praise beside O blame me not if I no more can write Look in your glass and there appears a face That overgoes my blunt invention quite Dulling my lines and doing me disgrace Were it not sinful then striving to mend To mar the subject that before was well For to no other pass my verses tend Than of your graces and your gifts to tell   And more much more than in my verse can sit   Your own glass shows you when you look in it                         To me fair friend you never can be old For as you were when first your eye I eyed Such seems your beauty still three winters cold Have from the forests shook three summers pride Three beauteous springs to yellow autumn turned In process of the seasons have I seen Three April perfumes in three hot Junes burned Since first I saw you fresh which yet are green Ah yet doth beauty like a dial hand Steal from his figure and no pace perceived So your sweet hue which methinks still doth stand Hath motion and mine eye may be deceived   For fear of which hear this thou age unbred   Ere you were born was beautys summer dead                         Let not my love be called idolatry Nor my beloved as an idol show Since all alike my songs and praises be To one of one still such and ever so Kind is my love today tomorrow kind Still constant in a wondrous excellence Therefore my verse to constancy confined One thing expressing leaves out difference Fair kind and true is all my argument Fair kind and true varying to other words And in this change is my invention spent Three themes in one which wondrous scope affords   Fair kind and true have often lived alone   Which three till now never kept seat in one                         When in the chronicle of wasted time I see descriptions of the fairest wights And beauty making beautiful old rhyme In praise of ladies dead and lovely knights Then in the blazon of sweet beautys best Of hand of foot of lip of eye of brow I see their antique pen would have expressed Even such a beauty as you master now So all their praises are but prophecies Of this our time all you prefiguring And for they looked but with divining eyes They had not skill enough your worth to sing   For we which now behold these present days   Have eyes to wonder but lack tongues to praise                         Not mine own fears nor the prophetic soul Of the wide world dreaming on things to come Can yet the lease of my true love control Supposed as forfeit to a confined doom The mortal moon hath her eclipse endured And the sad augurs mock their own presage Incertainties now crown themselves assured And peace proclaims olives of endless age Now with the drops of this most balmy time My love looks fresh and death to me subscribes Since spite of him Ill live in this poor rhyme While he insults oer dull and speechless tribes   And thou in this shalt find thy monument   When tyrants crests and tombs of brass are spent                         Whats in the brain that ink may character Which hath not figured to thee my true spirit Whats new to speak what now to register That may express my love or thy dear merit Nothing sweet boy but yet like prayers divine I must each day say oer the very same Counting no old thing old thou mine I thine Even as when first I hallowed thy fair name So that eternal love in loves fresh case Weighs not the dust and injury of age Nor gives to necessary wrinkles place But makes antiquity for aye his page   Finding the first conceit of love there bred   Where time and outward form would show it dead                         O never say that I was false of heart Though absence seemed my flame to qualify As easy might I from my self depart As from my soul which in thy breast doth lie That is my home of love if I have ranged Like him that travels I return again Just to the time not with the time exchanged So that my self bring water for my stain Never believe though in my nature reigned All frailties that besiege all kinds of blood That it could so preposterously be stained To leave for nothing all thy sum of good   For nothing this wide universe I call   Save thou my rose in it thou art my all                         Alas tis true I have gone here and there And made my self a motley to the view Gored mine own thoughts sold cheap what is most dear Made old offences of affections new Most true it is that I have looked on truth Askance and strangely but by all above These blenches gave my heart another youth And worse essays proved thee my best of love Now all is done have what shall have no end Mine appetite I never more will grind On newer proof to try an older friend A god in love to whom I am confined   Then give me welcome next my heaven the best   Even to thy pure and most most loving breast                         O for my sake do you with Fortune chide The guilty goddess of my harmful deeds That did not better for my life provide Than public means which public manners breeds Thence comes it that my name receives a brand And almost thence my nature is subdued To what it works in like the dyers hand Pity me then and wish I were renewed Whilst like a willing patient I will drink Potions of eisel gainst my strong infection No bitterness that I will bitter think Nor double penance to correct correction   Pity me then dear friend and I assure ye   Even that your pity is enough to cure me                         Your love and pity doth th impression fill Which vulgar scandal stamped upon my brow For what care I who calls me well or ill So you oergreen my bad my good allow You are my all the world and I must strive To know my shames and praises from your tongue None else to me nor I to none alive That my steeled sense or changes right or wrong In so profound abysm I throw all care Of others voices that my adders sense To critic and to flatterer stopped are Mark how with my neglect I do dispense   You are so strongly in my purpose bred   That all the world besides methinks are dead                         Since I left you mine eye is in my mind And that which governs me to go about Doth part his function and is partly blind Seems seeing but effectually is out For it no form delivers to the heart Of bird of flower or shape which it doth latch Of his quick objects hath the mind no part Nor his own vision holds what it doth catch For if it see the rudst or gentlest sight The most sweet favour or deformedst creature The mountain or the sea the day or night The crow or dove it shapes them to your feature   Incapable of more replete with you   My most true mind thus maketh mine untrue                         Or whether doth my mind being crowned with you Drink up the monarchs plague this flattery Or whether shall I say mine eye saith true And that your love taught it this alchemy To make of monsters and things indigest Such cherubins as your sweet self resemble Creating every bad a perfect best As fast as objects to his beams assemble O tis the first tis flattery in my seeing And my great mind most kingly drinks it up Mine eye well knows what with his gust is greeing And to his palate doth prepare the cup   If it be poisoned tis the lesser sin   That mine eye loves it and doth first begin                         Those lines that I before have writ do lie Even those that said I could not love you dearer Yet then my judgment knew no reason why My most full flame should afterwards burn clearer But reckoning time whose millioned accidents Creep in twixt vows and change decrees of kings Tan sacred beauty blunt the sharpst intents Divert strong minds to the course of altring things Alas why fearing of times tyranny Might I not then say Now I love you best When I was certain oer incertainty Crowning the present doubting of the rest   Love is a babe then might I not say so   To give full growth to that which still doth grow                         Let me not to the marriage of true minds Admit impediments love is not love Which alters when it alteration finds Or bends with the remover to remove O no it is an everfixed mark That looks on tempests and is never shaken It is the star to every wandring bark Whose worths unknown although his height be taken Loves not Times fool though rosy lips and cheeks Within his bending sickles compass come Love alters not with his brief hours and weeks But bears it out even to the edge of doom   If this be error and upon me proved   I never writ nor no man ever loved                         Accuse me thus that I have scanted all Wherein I should your great deserts repay Forgot upon your dearest love to call Whereto all bonds do tie me day by day That I have frequent been with unknown minds And given to time your own dearpurchased right That I have hoisted sail to all the winds Which should transport me farthest from your sight Book both my wilfulness and errors down And on just proof surmise accumulate Bring me within the level of your frown But shoot not at me in your wakened hate   Since my appeal says I did strive to prove   The constancy and virtue of your love                         Like as to make our appetite more keen With eager compounds we our palate urge As to prevent our maladies unseen We sicken to shun sickness when we purge Even so being full of your neercloying sweetness To bitter sauces did I frame my feeding And sick of welfare found a kind of meetness To be diseased ere that there was true needing Thus policy in love t anticipate The ills that were not grew to faults assured And brought to medicine a healthful state Which rank of goodness would by ill be cured   But thence I learn and find the lesson true   Drugs poison him that so feil sick of you                         What potions have I drunk of Siren tears Distilled from limbecks foul as hell within Applying fears to hopes and hopes to fears Still losing when I saw my self to win What wretched errors hath my heart committed Whilst it hath thought it self so blessed never How have mine eyes out of their spheres been fitted In the distraction of this madding fever O benefit of ill now I find true That better is by evil still made better And ruined love when it is built anew Grows fairer than at first more strong far greater   So I return rebuked to my content   And gain by ills thrice more than I have spent                         That you were once unkind befriends me now And for that sorrow which I then did feel Needs must I under my transgression bow Unless my nerves were brass or hammered steel For if you were by my unkindness shaken As I by yours yhave passed a hell of time And I a tyrant have no leisure taken To weigh how once I suffered in your crime O that our night of woe might have remembered My deepest sense how hard true sorrow hits And soon to you as you to me then tendered The humble salve which wounded bosoms fits   But that your trespass now becomes a fee   Mine ransoms yours and yours must ransom me                         Tis better to be vile than vile esteemed When not to be receives reproach of being And the just pleasure lost which is so deemed Not by our feeling but by others seeing For why should others false adulterate eyes Give salutation to my sportive blood Or on my frailties why are frailer spies Which in their wills count bad what I think good No I am that I am and they that level At my abuses reckon up their own I may be straight though they themselves be bevel By their rank thoughts my deeds must not be shown   Unless this general evil they maintain   All men are bad and in their badness reign                         Thy gift thy tables are within my brain Full charactered with lasting memory Which shall above that idle rank remain Beyond all date even to eternity Or at the least so long as brain and heart Have faculty by nature to subsist Till each to razed oblivion yield his part Of thee thy record never can be missed That poor retention could not so much hold Nor need I tallies thy dear love to score Therefore to give them from me was I bold To trust those tables that receive thee more   To keep an adjunct to remember thee   Were to import forgetfulness in me                         No Time thou shalt not boast that I do change Thy pyramids built up with newer might To me are nothing novel nothing strange They are but dressings Of a former sight Our dates are brief and therefore we admire What thou dost foist upon us that is old And rather make them born to our desire Than think that we before have heard them told Thy registers and thee I both defy Not wondring at the present nor the past For thy records and what we see doth lie Made more or less by thy continual haste   This I do vow and this shall ever be   I will be true despite thy scythe and thee                         If my dear love were but the child of state It might for Fortunes bastard be unfathered As subject to times love or to times hate Weeds among weeds or flowers with flowers gathered No it was builded far from accident It suffers not in smiling pomp nor falls Under the blow of thralled discontent Whereto th inviting time our fashion calls It fears not policy that heretic Which works on leases of shortnumbered hours But all alone stands hugely politic That it nor grows with heat nor drowns with showers   To this I witness call the fools of time   Which die for goodness who have lived for crime                         Weret aught to me I bore the canopy With my extern the outward honouring Or laid great bases for eternity Which proves more short than waste or ruining Have I not seen dwellers on form and favour Lose all and more by paying too much rent For compound sweet forgoing simple savour Pitiful thrivers in their gazing spent No let me be obsequious in thy heart And take thou my oblation poor but free Which is not mixed with seconds knows no art But mutual render only me for thee   Hence thou suborned informer a true soul   When most impeached stands least in thy control                         O thou my lovely boy who in thy power Dost hold Times fickle glass his fickle hour Who hast by waning grown and therein showst Thy lovers withering as thy sweet self growst If Nature sovereign mistress over wrack As thou goest onwards still will pluck thee back She keeps thee to this purpose that her skill May time disgrace and wretched minutes kill Yet fear her O thou minion of her pleasure She may detain but not still keep her treasure   Her audit though delayed answered must be   And her quietus is to render thee                         In the old age black was not counted fair Or if it were it bore not beautys name But now is black beautys successive heir And beauty slandered with a bastard shame For since each hand hath put on natures power Fairing the foul with arts false borrowed face Sweet beauty hath no name no holy bower But is profaned if not lives in disgrace Therefore my mistress eyes are raven black Her eyes so suited and they mourners seem At such who not born fair no beauty lack Slandering creation with a false esteem   Yet so they mourn becoming of their woe   That every tongue says beauty should look so                         How oft when thou my music music playst Upon that blessed wood whose motion sounds With thy sweet fingers when thou gently swayst The wiry concord that mine ear confounds Do I envy those jacks that nimble leap To kiss the tender inward of thy hand Whilst my poor lips which should that harvest reap At the woods boldness by thee blushing stand To be so tickled they would change their state And situation with those dancing chips Oer whom thy fingers walk with gentle gait Making dead wood more blest than living lips   Since saucy jacks so happy are in this   Give them thy fingers me thy lips to kiss                         Th expense of spirit in a waste of shame Is lust in action and till action lust Is perjured murdrous bloody full of blame Savage extreme rude cruel not to trust Enjoyed no sooner but despised straight Past reason hunted and no sooner had Past reason hated as a swallowed bait On purpose laid to make the taker mad Mad in pursuit and in possession so Had having and in quest to have extreme A bliss in proof and proved a very woe Before a joy proposed behind a dream   All this the world well knows yet none knows well   To shun the heaven that leads men to this hell                         My mistress eyes are nothing like the sun Coral is far more red than her lips red If snow be white why then her breasts are dun If hairs be wires black wires grow on her head I have seen roses damasked red and white But no such roses see I in her cheeks And in some perfumes is there more delight Than in the breath that from my mistress reeks I love to hear her speak yet well I know That music hath a far more pleasing sound I grant I never saw a goddess go My mistress when she walks treads on the ground   And yet by heaven I think my love as rare   As any she belied with false compare                         Thou art as tyrannous so as thou art As those whose beauties proudly make them cruel For well thou knowst to my dear doting heart Thou art the fairest and most precious jewel Yet in good faith some say that thee behold Thy face hath not the power to make love groan To say they err I dare not be so bold Although I swear it to my self alone And to be sure that is not false I swear A thousand groans but thinking on thy face One on anothers neck do witness bear Thy black is fairest in my judgments place   In nothing art thou black save in thy deeds   And thence this slander as I think proceeds                         Thine eyes I love and they as pitying me Knowing thy heart torment me with disdain Have put on black and loving mourners be Looking with pretty ruth upon my pain And truly not the morning sun of heaven Better becomes the grey cheeks of the east Nor that full star that ushers in the even Doth half that glory to the sober west As those two mourning eyes become thy face O let it then as well beseem thy heart To mourn for me since mourning doth thee grace And suit thy pity like in every part   Then will I swear beauty herself is black   And all they foul that thy complexion lack                         Beshrew that heart that makes my heart to groan For that deep wound it gives my friend and me Ist not enough to torture me alone But slave to slavery my sweetst friend must be Me from my self thy cruel eye hath taken And my next self thou harder hast engrossed Of him my self and thee I am forsaken A torment thrice threefold thus to be crossed Prison my heart in thy steel bosoms ward But then my friends heart let my poor heart bail Whoeer keeps me let my heart be his guard Thou canst not then use rigour in my gaol   And yet thou wilt for I being pent in thee   Perforce am thine and all that is in me                         So now I have confessed that he is thine And I my self am mortgaged to thy will My self Ill forfeit so that other mine Thou wilt restore to be my comfort still But thou wilt not nor he will not be free For thou art covetous and he is kind He learned but suretylike to write for me Under that bond that him as fist doth bind The statute of thy beauty thou wilt take Thou usurer that putst forth all to use And sue a friend came debtor for my sake So him I lose through my unkind abuse   Him have I lost thou hast both him and me   He pays the whole and yet am I not free                         Whoever hath her wish thou hast thy will And Will to boot and Will in overplus More than enough am I that vex thee still To thy sweet will making addition thus Wilt thou whose will is large and spacious Not once vouchsafe to hide my will in thine Shall will in others seem right gracious And in my will no fair acceptance shine The sea all water yet receives rain still And in abundance addeth to his store So thou being rich in will add to thy will One will of mine to make thy large will more   Let no unkind no fair beseechers kill   Think all but one and me in that one Will                         If thy soul check thee that I come so near Swear to thy blind soul that I was thy Will And will thy soul knows is admitted there Thus far for love my lovesuit sweet fulfil Will will fulfil the treasure of thy love Ay fill it full with wills and my will one In things of great receipt with case we prove Among a number one is reckoned none Then in the number let me pass untold Though in thy stores account I one must be For nothing hold me so it please thee hold That nothing me a something sweet to thee   Make but my name thy love and love that still   And then thou lovst me for my name is Will                         Thou blind fool Love what dost thou to mine eyes That they behold and see not what they see They know what beauty is see where it lies Yet what the best is take the worst to be If eyes corrupt by overpartial looks Be anchored in the bay where all men ride Why of eyes falsehood hast thou forged hooks Whereto the judgment of my heart is tied Why should my heart think that a several plot Which my heart knows the wide worlds common place Or mine eyes seeing this say this is not To put fair truth upon so foul a face   In things right true my heart and eyes have erred   And to this false plague are they now transferred                         When my love swears that she is made of truth I do believe her though I know she lies That she might think me some untutored youth Unlearned in the worlds false subtleties Thus vainly thinking that she thinks me young Although she knows my days are past the best Simply I credit her falsespeaking tongue On both sides thus is simple truth suppressed But wherefore says she not she is unjust And wherefore say not I that I am old O loves best habit is in seeming trust And age in love loves not to have years told   Therefore I lie with her and she with me   And in our faults by lies we flattered be                         O call not me to justify the wrong That thy unkindness lays upon my heart Wound me not with thine eye but with thy tongue Use power with power and slay me not by art Tell me thou lovst elsewhere but in my sight Dear heart forbear to glance thine eye aside What needst thou wound with cunning when thy might Is more than my oerpressed defence can bide Let me excuse thee ah my love well knows Her pretty looks have been mine enemies And therefore from my face she turns my foes That they elsewhere might dart their injuries   Yet do not so but since I am near slain   Kill me outright with looks and rid my pain                         Be wise as thou art cruel do not press My tonguetied patience with too much disdain Lest sorrow lend me words and words express The manner of my pitywanting pain If I might teach thee wit better it were Though not to love yet love to tell me so As testy sick men when their deaths be near No news but health from their physicians know For if I should despair I should grow mad And in my madness might speak ill of thee Now this illwresting world is grown so bad Mad slanderers by mad ears believed be   That I may not be so nor thou belied   Bear thine eyes straight though thy proud heart go wide                         In faith I do not love thee with mine eyes For they in thee a thousand errors note But tis my heart that loves what they despise Who in despite of view is pleased to dote Nor are mine cars with thy tongues tune delighted Nor tender feeling to base touches prone Nor taste nor smell desire to be invited To any sensual feast with thee alone But my five wits nor my five senses can Dissuade one foolish heart from serving thee Who leaves unswayed the likeness of a man Thy proud hearts slave and vassal wretch to be   Only my plague thus far I count my gain   That she that makes me sin awards me pain                         Love is my sin and thy dear virtue hate Hate of my sin grounded on sinful loving O but with mine compare thou thine own state And thou shalt find it merits not reproving Or if it do not from those lips of thine That have profaned their scarlet ornaments And sealed false bonds of love as oft as mine Robbed others beds revenues of their rents Be it lawful I love thee as thou lovst those Whom thine eyes woo as mine importune thee Root pity in thy heart that when it grows Thy pity may deserve to pitied be   If thou dost seek to have what thou dost hide   By selfexample mayst thou be denied                         Lo as a careful huswife runs to catch One of her feathered creatures broke away Sets down her babe and makes all swift dispatch In pursuit of the thing she would have stay Whilst her neglected child holds her in chase Cries to catch her whose busy care is bent To follow that which flies before her face Not prizing her poor infants discontent So runst thou after that which flies from thee Whilst I thy babe chase thee afar behind But if thou catch thy hope turn back to me And play the mothers part kiss me be kind   So will I pray that thou mayst have thy Will   If thou turn back and my loud crying still                         Two loves I have of comfort and despair Which like two spirits do suggest me still The better angel is a man right fair The worser spirit a woman coloured ill To win me soon to hell my female evil Tempteth my better angel from my side And would corrupt my saint to be a devil Wooing his purity with her foul pride And whether that my angel be turned fiend Suspect I may yet not directly tell But being both from me both to each friend I guess one angel in anothers hell   Yet this shall I neer know but live in doubt   Till my bad angel fire my good one out                         Those lips that Loves own hand did make Breathed forth the sound that said I hate To me that languished for her sake But when she saw my woeful state Straight in her heart did mercy come Chiding that tongue that ever sweet Was used in giving gentle doom And taught it thus anew to greet I hate she altered with an end That followed it as gentle day Doth follow night who like a fiend From heaven to hell is flown away   I hate from hate away she threw   And saved my life saying not you                         Poor soul the centre of my sinful earth My sinful earth these rebel powers array Why dost thou pine within and suffer dearth Painting thy outward walls so costly gay Why so large cost having so short a lease Dost thou upon thy fading mansion spend Shall worms inheritors of this excess Eat up thy charge is this thy bodys end Then soul live thou upon thy servants loss And let that pine to aggravate thy store Buy terms divine in selling hours of dross Within be fed without be rich no more   So shall thou feed on death that feeds on men   And death once dead theres no more dying then                         My love is as a fever longing still For that which longer nurseth the disease Feeding on that which doth preserve the ill Th uncertain sickly appetite to please My reason the physician to my love Angry that his prescriptions are not kept Hath left me and I desperate now approve Desire is death which physic did except Past cure I am now reason is past care And franticmad with evermore unrest My thoughts and my discourse as mad mens are At random from the truth vainly expressed   For I have sworn thee fair and thought thee bright   Who art as black as hell as dark as night                         O me what eyes hath love put in my head Which have no correspondence with true sight Or if they have where is my judgment fled That censures falsely what they see aright If that be fair whereon my false eyes dote What means the world to say it is not so If it be not then love doth well denote Loves eye is not so true as all mens no How can it O how can loves eye be true That is so vexed with watching and with tears No marvel then though I mistake my view The sun it self sees not till heaven clears   O cunning love with tears thou keepst me blind   Lest eyes wellseeing thy foul faults should find                         Canst thou O cruel say I love thee not When I against my self with thee partake Do I not think on thee when I forgot Am of my self alltyrant for thy sake Who hateth thee that I do call my friend On whom frownst thou that I do fawn upon Nay if thou lourst on me do I not spend Revenge upon my self with present moan What merit do I in my self respect That is so proud thy service to despise When all my best doth worship thy defect Commanded by the motion of thine eyes   But love hate on for now I know thy mind   Those that can see thou lovst and I am blind                         O from what power hast thou this powerful might With insufficiency my heart to sway To make me give the lie to my true sight And swear that brightness doth not grace the day Whence hast thou this becoming of things ill That in the very refuse of thy deeds There is such strength and warrantise of skill That in my mind thy worst all best exceeds Who taught thee how to make me love thee more The more I hear and see just cause of hate O though I love what others do abhor With others thou shouldst not abhor my state   If thy unworthiness raised love in me   More worthy I to be beloved of thee                         Love is too young to know what conscience is Yet who knows not conscience is born of love Then gentle cheater urge not my amiss Lest guilty of my faults thy sweet self prove For thou betraying me I do betray My nobler part to my gross bodys treason My soul doth tell my body that he may Triumph in love flesh stays no farther reason But rising at thy name doth point out thee As his triumphant prize proud of this pride He is contented thy poor drudge to be To stand in thy affairs fall by thy side   No want of conscience hold it that I call   Her love for whose dear love I rise and fall                         In loving thee thou knowst I am forsworn But thou art twice forsworn to me love swearing In act thy bedvow broke and new faith torn In vowing new hate after new love bearing But why of two oaths breach do I accuse thee When I break twenty I am perjured most For all my vows are oaths but to misuse thee And all my honest faith in thee is lost For I have sworn deep oaths of thy deep kindness Oaths of thy love thy truth thy constancy And to enlighten thee gave eyes to blindness Or made them swear against the thing they see   For I have sworn thee fair more perjured I   To swear against the truth so foul a be                         Cupid laid by his brand and fell asleep A maid of Dians this advantage found And his lovekindling fire did quickly steep In a cold valleyfountain of that ground Which borrowed from this holy fire of Love A dateless lively heat still to endure And grew a seeting bath which yet men prove Against strange maladies a sovereign cure But at my mistress eye Loves brand newfired The boy for trial needs would touch my breast I sick withal the help of bath desired And thither hied a sad distempered guest   But found no cure the bath for my help lies   Where Cupid got new fire my mistress eyes                         The little Lovegod lying once asleep Laid by his side his heartinflaming brand Whilst many nymphs that vowed chaste life to keep Came tripping by but in her maiden hand The fairest votary took up that fire Which many legions of true hearts had warmed And so the general of hot desire Was sleeping by a virgin hand disarmed This brand she quenched in a cool well by Which from Loves fire took heat perpetual Growing a bath and healthful remedy For men discased but I my mistress thrall   Came there for cure and this by that I prove   Loves fire heats water water cools not love   THE END    ALLS WELL THAT ENDS WELL    Contents  ACT I Scene I Rossillon A room in the Countesss palace

his bright radiance and collateral light Must I be comforted not in his sphere Thambition in my love thus plagues itself The hind that would be mated by the lion Must die for love Twas pretty though a plague To see him every hour to sit and draw His arched brows his hawking eye his curls In our hearts tableheart too capable Of every line and trick of his sweet favour But now hes gone and my idolatrous fancy Must sanctify his relics Who comes here   Enter Parolles  One that goes with him I love him for his sake And yet I know him a notorious liar Think him a great way fool solely a coward

Virginity being blown down man will quicklier be blown up marry in blowing him down again with the breach yourselves made you lose your city It is not politic in the commonwealth of nature to preserve virginity Loss of virginity is rational increase and there was never virgin got till virginity was first lost That you were made of is metal to make virgins Virginity by being once lost may be ten times found by being ever kept it is ever lost Tis too cold a companion Away with it  HELENA I will stand fort a little though therefore I die a virgin  PAROLLES Theres little can be said int tis against the rule of nature To speak on the part of virginity is to accuse your mothers which is most infallible disobedience He that hangs himself is a virgin virginity murders itself and should be buried in highways out of all sanctified limit as a desperate offendress against nature Virginity breeds mites much like a cheese consumes itself to the very paring and so dies with feeding his own stomach Besides virginity is peevish proud idle made of selflove which is the most inhibited sin in the canon Keep it not you cannot choose but lose byt Out witht Within the year it will make itself two which is a goodly increase and the principal itself not much the worse Away with it  HELENA How might one do sir to lose it to her own liking  PAROLLES Let me see Marry ill to like him that neer it likes Tis a commodity will lose the gloss with lying the longer kept the less worth Off witht while tis vendible answer the time of request Virginity like an old courtier wears her cap out of fashion richly suited but unsuitable just like the brooch and the toothpick which wear not now Your date is better in your pie and your porridge than in your cheek And your virginity your old virginity is like one of our French witherd pears it looks ill it eats drily marry tis a witherd pear it was formerly better marry yet tis a witherd pear Will you anything with it  HELENA Not my

answer thee acutely I will return perfect courtier in the which my instruction shall serve to naturalize thee so thou wilt be capable of a courtiers counsel and understand what advice shall thrust upon thee else thou diest in thine unthankfulness and thine ignorance makes thee away Farewell When thou hast leisure say thy prayers when thou hast none remember thy friends Get thee a good husband and use him as he uses thee So farewell   Exit  HELENA Our remedies oft in ourselves do lie Which we ascribe to heaven the fated sky Gives us free scope only doth backward pull Our slow designs when we ourselves are dull What power is it which mounts my love so high That makes me see and cannot feed mine eye The mightiest space in fortune nature brings To join like likes and kiss like native things Impossible be strange attempts to those That weigh their pains in sense and do suppose What hath been cannot be Who ever strove To show her merit that did miss her love The kings diseasemy

First tried our soldiership He did look far Into the service of the time and was Discipled of the bravest He lasted long But on us both did haggish age steal on And wore us out of act It much repairs me To talk of your good father in his youth He had the wit which I can well observe Today in our young lords but they may jest Till their own scorn return to them unnoted Ere they can hide their levity in honour So like a courtier contempt nor bitterness Were in his pride or sharpness if they were His equal had awakd them and his honour Clock to itself knew the true minute when Exception bid him speak and at this time His tongue obeyd his hand Who were below him He usd as creatures of another place And bowd his eminent top to their low ranks Making them proud of his humility In their poor praise he humbled Such a man Might be a copy to these younger times Which followed well would demonstrate them now But goers backward  BERTRAM His good remembrance sir Lies richer in your thoughts than on his tomb So in approof lives not his epitaph As in your royal speech  KING Would I were with him He would always say Methinks I hear him now his plausive words He scatterd not in ears but grafted them To grow there and to bearLet me not live This his good melancholy oft began On the catastrophe and heel of pastime When it was outLet me not live quoth he After my flame lacks oil to be the snuff Of younger spirits whose apprehensive senses All but new things disdain whose judgments are Mere fathers of their garments whose constancies Expire before their fashions This he wishd I

henceforth know     It is not Caesars natural vice to hate     Our great competitor From Alexandria     This is the news he fishes drinks and wastes     The lamps of night in revel is not more manlike     Than Cleopatra nor the queen of Ptolemy     More womanly than he hardly gave audience or     Vouchsafd to think he had partners You shall find there     A man who is the abstract of all faults     That all men follow   LEPIDUS I must not think there are     Evils enow to darken all his goodness     His faults in him seem as the spots of heaven     More fiery by nights blackness hereditary     Rather than purchasd what he cannot change     Than what he chooses   CAESAR You are too indulgent Lets grant it is not     Amiss to tumble on the bed of Ptolemy     To give a kingdom for a mirth to sit     And keep the turn of tippling with a slave     To reel the streets at noon and stand the buffet     With knaves that smell of sweat Say this becomes him     As his composure must be rare indeed     Whom these things cannot blemish yet must Antony     No way excuse his foils when we do bear     So great weight in his lightness If he filld     His vacancy with his voluptuousness     Full surfeits and the dryness of his bones     Call on him fort But to confound such time     That drums him from his sport and speaks as loud     As his own state and ours tis to be chid     As we

Caesar To the ports     The discontents repair and mens reports     Give him much wrongd   CAESAR I should have known no less     It hath been taught us from the primal state     That he which is was wishd until he were     And the ebbd man neer lovd till neer worth love     Comes deard by being lackd This common body     Like to a vagabond flag upon the stream     Goes to and back lackeying the varying tide     To rot itself with motion   MESSENGER Caesar I bring thee word     Menecrates and Menas famous pirates     Make the sea serve them which they ear and wound     With keels of every kind Many hot inroads     They make in Italy the borders maritime     Lack blood to think ont and flush youth revolt     No vessel can peep forth but tis as soon     Taken as seen for Pompeys name

you in Egypt Yet if you there     Did practise on my state your being in Egypt     Might be my question   ANTONY How intend you practisd   CAESAR You may be pleasd to catch at mine intent     By what did here befall me Your wife and brother     Made wars upon me and their contestation     Was theme for you you were the word of war   ANTONY You do mistake your business my brother never     Did urge me in his act I did inquire it     And have my learning from some true reports     That drew their swords with you Did he not rather     Discredit my authority with yours     And make the wars alike against my stomach     Having alike your cause Of this my letters     Before did satisfy you If youll patch a quarrel     As matter whole you have not to make it with     It must not be with this   CAESAR You praise yourself     By laying defects of judgment to me but     You patchd up your excuses   ANTONY Not so not so     I know you could not lack I am certain ont     Very necessity of this

knit your hearts     With an unslipping knot take Antony     Octavia to his wife whose beauty claims     No worse a husband than the best of men     Whose virtue and whose general graces speak     That which none else can utter By this marriage     All little jealousies which now seem great     And all great fears which now import their dangers     Would then be nothing Truths would be tales     Where now half tales be truths Her love to both     Would each to other and all loves to both     Draw after her Pardon what I have spoke     For tis a studied not a present thought     By duty ruminated   ANTONY Will Caesar speak   CAESAR Not till he hears how Antony is touchd     With what is spoke already   ANTONY What power is in Agrippa     If I would say Agrippa be it so     To make this good   CAESAR The power of Caesar and     His power unto Octavia   ANTONY May I never     To this good purpose that so fairly shows     Dream of impediment Let me have thy hand     Further this act of grace and from this hour     The heart of brothers govern in our loves     And sway our great designs   CAESAR There is my hand     A sister I bequeath you whom no brother     Did ever love so dearly Let her live     To join our kingdoms and our hearts and never     Fly off our loves again   LEPIDUS Happily amen   ANTONY I did not think to draw my sword gainst Pompey     For he hath laid

SCENE I The Forest of Arden  Enter DUKE SENIOR AMIENS and two or three LORDS like foresters    DUKE SENIOR Now my comates and brothers in exile     Hath not old custom made this life more sweet     Than that of painted pomp Are not these woods     More free from peril than the envious court     Here feel we not the penalty of Adam     The seasons difference as the icy fang     And churlish chiding of the winters wind     Which when it bites and blows upon my body     Even till I shrink with cold I smile and say     This is no flattery these are counsellors     That feelingly persuade me what I am     Sweet are the uses of adversity     Which like the toad ugly and venomous     Wears yet a precious jewel in his head     And this our life exempt from public haunt     Finds tongues in trees books in the running brooks     Sermons in stones and good in everything     I would not change it   AMIENS Happy is your Grace     That can translate the stubbornness of fortune     Into so quiet and so sweet a style   DUKE SENIOR Come shall we go and kill us venison     And yet it irks me the poor dappled fools     Being native burghers of this desert city     Should in their own confines with forked heads     Have their round haunches gord   FIRST LORD Indeed my lord     The melancholy Jaques grieves at that     And in that kind swears you do more usurp     Than doth your brother that hath banishd you     Today my Lord of Amiens and myself     Did steal behind him as he lay along     Under an oak whose antique root peeps out     Upon the brook that brawls along this wood     To the which place a poor sequestred stag     That from the hunters aim had taen a hurt     Did come to languish and indeed my lord     The wretched animal heavd forth such groans     That their discharge did stretch his leathern coat     Almost to bursting and the big round tears     Coursd one another down his innocent nose     In piteous chase and thus the hairy fool     Much marked of the melancholy Jaques     Stood on th extremest verge of the swift brook     Augmenting it with tears   DUKE SENIOR But what said Jaques     Did he not moralize this spectacle   FIRST LORD O yes into a thousand similes     First for his weeping into the needless stream     Poor deer quoth he thou makst a testament     As worldlings do giving thy sum of more     To that which had too much Then being there alone     Left and abandoned of his velvet friends     Tis right quoth he thus misery doth part     The flux of company Anon a careless herd     Full of the pasture jumps along by him     And never stays to greet him Ay quoth Jaques     Sweep on you fat and greasy citizens     Tis just the fashion Wherefore do you look     Upon that poor and broken bankrupt there     Thus most invectively he pierceth through     The body of the country city court     Yea and of this our life swearing that we     Are mere usurpers tyrants and whats worse     To fright the animals and to kill them up     In their assignd and native dwellingplace   DUKE SENIOR And did you leave him in this contemplation   SECOND LORD We did my lord weeping and commenting     Upon the sobbing deer   DUKE SENIOR Show me the place     I love to cope him in these sullen fits     For then hes full of matter   FIRST LORD Ill bring you to him straight             Exeunt  SCENE II The DUKES palace  Enter DUKE FREDERICK with LORDS    FREDERICK Can it be possible that no man saw them     It cannot be some villains of my court     Are of consent and sufferance in this   FIRST LORD I cannot hear of any that did see her     The ladies her attendants of her chamber     Saw her abed and in the morning early     They found the bed untreasurd of their mistress   SECOND LORD My lord the roynish clown at whom so oft     Your Grace was wont to laugh is also missing     Hisperia the Princess gentlewoman     Confesses that she secretly oerheard     Your daughter and her cousin much commend     The parts and graces of the wrestler     That did but lately foil the sinewy Charles     And she believes wherever they are gone     That youth is surely in their company   FREDERICK Send to his brother fetch

humorous Duke     Your praise is come too swiftly home before you     Know you not master to some kind of men     Their graces serve them but as enemies     No more do yours Your virtues gentle master     Are sanctified and holy traitors to you     O what a world is this when what is comely     Envenoms him that bears it   ORLANDO Why whats the matter   ADAM O unhappy youth     Come not within

Hath heard your praises and this night he means     To burn the lodging where you use to lie     And you within it If he fail of that     He will have other means to cut you off     I overheard him and his practices     This is no place this house is but a butchery     Abhor it fear it do not enter it   ORLANDO Why whither Adam wouldst thou have me go   ADAM No matter whither so you come not here   ORLANDO What wouldst thou have me go and beg my food     Or with a base and boistrous sword enforce     A thievish living on the common road     This I must do or know not what to do     Yet this I will not do do how I can     I rather will subject me to the malice     Of a diverted blood and bloody brother   ADAM But do not so I have five hundred crowns     The thrifty hire I savd under your father     Which I did store to be my fosternurse     When service should in my old limbs lie lame     And unregarded age in corners thrown     Take that and He that doth the ravens feed     Yea providently caters for the sparrow     Be comfort to my age Here is the gold     All this I give you Let me be your servant     Though I look old yet I am strong and lusty     For in my youth I never did apply     Hot and rebellious liquors in my blood     Nor did not with unbashful forehead woo     The means of weakness and debility     Therefore my age is as a lusty winter     Frosty but kindly Let me go with you     Ill do the service of a younger man     In all your business and necessities   ORLANDO O good old man how well in thee appears     The constant service of the antique world     When service sweat for duty not for meed     Thou art not for the fashion of these times     Where none will sweat but for promotion     And having that do choke their service up     Even with the having it is not so with thee     But poor old man thou prunst a rotten tree     That cannot so much as a blossom yield     In lieu of all thy pains and husbandry     But come thy ways well go along

seventeen years till now almost fourscore     Here lived I but now live here no more     At seventeen years many their fortunes seek     But at fourscore it is too late a week     Yet fortune cannot

purchase in so removed a   dwelling ROSALIND I have been told so of many but indeed an old   religious uncle of mine taught me to speak who was in his youth an   inland man one that knew courtship too well for there he fell in   love I have heard him read many lectures against it and I thank God   I am not a woman to be touchd with so many giddy offences as he   hath generally taxd their whole sex withal ORLANDO Can you   remember any of the principal evils that he laid to the charge of   women ROSALIND There were none principal they were all like one   another as halfpence are every one fault seeming monstrous till his   fellowfault came to match it ORLANDO I prithee recount some of   them ROSALIND No I will not cast away my physic but on those that   are sick There is a man haunts the forest that abuses our young   plants with carving Rosalind on their barks hangs odes upon   hawthorns and elegies on brambles all forsooth deifying the name   of Rosalind If I could meet that

revenue Then your hose should be   ungarterd your bonnet unbanded your sleeve unbuttond your shoe   untied and every thing about you demonstrating a careless   desolation But you are no such man you are rather pointdevice in   your accoutrements as loving yourself than seeming the lover of any   other ORLANDO Fair youth I would I could make thee believe I love   ROSALIND Me believe it You may as soon make her that you love   believe it which I warrant she is apter to do than to confess she   does That is one of the points in the which women still give the lie   to their consciences But in good sooth are you he that hangs the   verses on the trees wherein Rosalind is so admired ORLANDO I swear   to thee youth by the white hand of Rosalind I am that he that   unfortunate he ROSALIND But are you so much in love as your rhymes   speak ORLANDO Neither rhyme nor reason can express how much   ROSALIND Love is merely a madness and I tell you deserves as well   a dark house and a whip as madmen do and the reason why they are not   so punishd and cured is that the lunacy is so ordinary that the   whippers are in love too Yet I profess curing it by counsel   ORLANDO Did you ever cure any so ROSALIND Yes one and in this   manner He was to imagine me his love his mistress and I set him   every day to woo me at which time would I being but a moonish   youth grieve be effeminate

Should be calld tyrants butchers murderers     Now I do frown on thee with all my heart     And if mine eyes can wound now let them kill thee     Now counterfeit to swoon why now fall down     Or if thou canst not O for shame for shame     Lie not to say mine eyes are murderers     Now show the wound mine eye hath made in thee     Scratch thee but with a pin and there remains     Some scar of it lean upon a rush     The cicatrice and capable impressure     Thy palm some moment keeps but now mine eyes     Which I have darted at thee hurt thee not     Nor I am sure there is not force in eyes     That can do hurt   SILVIUS O dear Phebe     If ever as that ever may be near     You meet in some fresh cheek the power of fancy     Then shall you know the wounds invisible     That loves keen

candle may go dark to bed     Must you be therefore proud and pitiless     Why what means this Why do you look on me     I see no more in you than in the ordinary     Of natures salework Ods my little life     I think she means to tangle my eyes too     No faith proud mistress hope not after it     Tis not your inky brows your black silk hair     Your bugle eyeballs nor your cheek of cream     That can entame my spirits to your worship     You foolish shepherd wherefore do you follow her     Like foggy south puffing with wind and rain     You are a thousand times a properer man     Than she a woman Tis such fools as you     That makes the world full of illfavourd children     Tis not her glass but you that flatters her     And out of you she sees herself more proper     Than any of her

speaks them pleases those that hear     It is a pretty youth not very pretty     But sure hes proud and yet his pride becomes him     Hell make a proper man The best thing in him     Is his complexion

lip     A little riper and more lusty red     Than that mixd in his cheek twas just the difference     Betwixt the constant red and mingled damask     There be some women Silvius had they markd him     In parcels as I did would have gone near     To fall in love with him but for my part     I love him not nor hate him not and yet     I have more cause to hate him than to love him     For what had he to do to chide at me     He said mine eyes were black and my hair black     And now I am remembred scornd at me     I marvel why I answerd not again     But thats all one omittance is no quittance     Ill write to him a very taunting letter     And thou shalt bear it wilt thou Silvius   SILVIUS Phebe with all my heart   PHEBE Ill write it straight     The matters in my head and in my heart     I will be bitter with him and passing short     Go with me Silvius                                  Exeunt  ACT IV SCENE I The forest  Enter ROSALIND CELIA and JAQUES    JAQUES I prithee pretty youth

politic nor the ladys     which is nice nor the lovers which is all these but it is a     melancholy of mine own compounded of many simples extracted     from many objects and indeed the sundry contemplation of my     travels in which my often rumination wraps me in a most humorous     sadness   ROSALIND A traveller By my faith you have great reason to be     sad I fear you have sold your

Syracusa plead no more I am not partial to infringe our laws The enmity and discord which of late Sprung from the rancorous outrage of your Duke To merchants our welldealing countrymen Who wanting guilders to redeem their lives Have seald his rigorous statutes with their bloods Excludes all pity from our threatning looks For since the mortal and intestine jars Twixt thy seditious countrymen and us It hath in solemn synods been decreed Both by the Syracusians and ourselves To admit no traffic to our adverse towns Nay more if any born at Ephesus Be seen at Syracusian marts and fairs Again if any Syracusian born Come to the bay of Ephesus he dies His goods confiscate to the Dukes dispose Unless a thousand marks be levied To quit the penalty and to ransom him Thy substance valued at the highest rate Cannot amount unto a hundred marks Therefore by law thou art condemnd to die  EGEON Yet this my comfort when your words are done My woes end likewise with the evening sun  DUKE Well Syracusian say in brief the cause Why thou departedst from thy native home And for what cause thou camst to Ephesus  EGEON A heavier task could not have been imposd Than I to speak my griefs unspeakable Yet that the world may witness that my end Was wrought by nature not by vile offence Ill utter what my sorrow gives me leave In Syracusa was I born and wed Unto a woman happy but for me And by me had not our hap been bad With her I livd in joy our wealth increasd By prosperous voyages I often made To Epidamnum till my factors death And the great care of goods at random left Drew me from kind embracements of my spouse From whom my absence was not six months old Before herself almost at fainting under The pleasing punishment that women bear Had made provision for her following me And soon and safe arrived where I was There had she not been long but she became A joyful mother of two goodly sons And which was strange the one so like the other As could not be distinguishd but by names That very hour and in the selfsame inn A mean woman was delivered Of such a burden male twins both alike Those for their parents were exceeding poor I bought and brought up to attend my sons My wife not meanly proud of two such boys Made daily motions for our home return Unwilling I agreed alas too soon We came aboard A league from Epidamnum had we saild Before the alwayswindobeying deep Gave any tragic instance of our harm But longer did we not retain much hope For what obscured light the heavens did grant Did but convey unto our fearful minds A doubtful warrant of immediate death Which though myself would gladly have embracd Yet the incessant weepings of my wife Weeping before for what she saw must come And piteous plainings of the pretty babes That mournd for fashion ignorant what to fear Forcd me to seek delays for them and me And this it was for other means was none The sailors sought for safety by our boat And left the ship then sinkingripe to us My wife more careful for the latterborn Had fastned him unto a small spare mast Such as seafaring men provide for storms To him one of the other twins was bound Whilst I had been like heedful of the other The children thus disposd my wife and I Fixing our eyes on whom our care was fixd Fastned ourselves at either end the mast And floating straight obedient to the stream Was carried towards Corinth as we thought At length the sun gazing upon the earth Dispersd those vapours that offended us And by the benefit of his wished light The seas waxd calm and we discovered Two ships from far making amain to us Of Corinth that of Epidaurus this But ere they cameO let me say no more Gather the sequel by that went before  DUKE Nay forward old man do not break off so For we may pity though not pardon thee  EGEON O had the gods done so I had not now Worthily termd them merciless to us For ere the ships could meet by twice five leagues We were encountered by a mighty rock Which being violently borne upon Our helpful ship was splitted in the midst So that in this unjust divorce of us Fortune had left to both of us alike What to delight in what to sorrow for Her part poor soul seeming as burdened With lesser weight but not with lesser woe Was carried with more speed before the wind And in our sight they three were taken up By fishermen of Corinth as we thought At length another ship had seizd on us And knowing whom it was their hap to save Gave healthful welcome to their shipwrackd guests And would have reft the fishers of their prey Had not their bark been very slow of sail And therefore homeward did they bend their course Thus have you heard me severd from my bliss That by misfortunes was my life prolongd To tell sad stories of my own mishaps  DUKE And for the sake of them thou sorrowest for Do me the favour to dilate at full What have befalln of them and thee till now  EGEON My youngest boy and yet my eldest care At eighteen years became inquisitive After his brother and importund me That his attendant so his case was like Reft of his brother but retaind his name Might bear him company in the quest of him Whom whilst I laboured of a love to see I hazarded the loss of whom I lovd Five summers have I spent in farthest Greece Roaming clean through the bounds of Asia And coasting homeward came to Ephesus Hopeless to find yet loath to leave unsought Or that or any place that harbours men But here must end the story of my life And happy were I in my timely death Could all my travels warrant me they live  DUKE Hapless Egeon whom the fates have markd To bear the extremity of dire mishap Now trust me were it not against our laws Against my crown my oath my dignity Which princes would they may not disannul My soul should sue as advocate for thee But though thou art adjudged to the death And passed sentence may not be recalld But to our honours great disparagement Yet will I favour thee in what I can Therefore merchant Ill limit thee this day To seek thy health by beneficial help Try all the friends thou hast in Ephesus Beg thou or borrow to make up the sum And live if no then thou art doomd to die Jailer take him to thy custody  JAILER I will my lord

Beneath abhorring What would you have you curs     That like nor peace nor war The one affrights you     The other makes you proud He that trusts to you     Where he should find you lions finds you hares     Where foxes geese you are no surer no     Than is the coal of fire upon the ice     Or hailstone in the sun Your virtue is     To make him worthy whose offence subdues him     And curse that justice did it Who deserves greatness     Deserves your hate and your affections are     A sick mans appetite who desires most that     Which would increase his evil He that depends     Upon your favours swims with fins of lead     And hews down oaks with rushes Hang ye Trust ye     With every minute you do change a mind     And call him noble that was now your hate     Him vile that was your

lance   MENENIUS Nay these are almost thoroughly persuaded     For though abundantly they lack discretion     Yet are they passing cowardly But I beseech you     What says the other troop   MARCIUS They are dissolvd Hang em     They said they were anhungry sighd forth proverbs     That hunger broke stone walls that dogs must eat     That meat was made for mouths that the gods sent not     Corn for the rich men only With these shreds     They vented their complainings which being answerd     And a petition granted them a strange one     To break the heart of generosity     And make bold power look pale they threw their caps     As they would hang them on the horns o th moon     Shouting their emulation   MENENIUS What is granted them   MARCIUS Five tribunes to defend their vulgar wisdoms     Of their own choice Ones Junius Brutus     Sicinius Velutus and I know not Sdeath     The rabble should have first unroofd the city     Ere so prevaild with me it will in time     Win upon

modest moon   BRUTUS The present wars devour him He is grown     Too proud to be so valiant   SICINIUS Such a nature     Tickled with good success disdains the shadow     Which he treads on at noon But I do wonder     His insolence can brook to be commanded     Under Cominius   BRUTUS Fame at the which he aims     In whom already he is well gracd cannot     Better be held nor more attaind than by     A place below the first for what miscarries     Shall be the generals fault though he perform     To th utmost of a man and giddy censure     Will then cry out of Marcius O if he     Had borne the business   SICINIUS Besides if things go well     Opinion that so sticks on Marcius shall     Of his demerits rob Cominius   BRUTUS Come     Half all Cominius honours are to Marcius     Though

 SICINIUS The lamb   MENENIUS Ay to devour him as the hungry plebeians would the     noble Marcius   BRUTUS Hes a lamb indeed that baes like a bear   MENENIUS Hes a bear indeed that lives fike a lamb You two are     old men tell me one thing that I shall ask you   BOTH TRIBUNES Well sir   MENENIUS In what enormity is Marcius poor in that you two have not     in abundance   BRUTUS Hes poor in no one fault but stord with all   SICINIUS Especially in pride   BRUTUS And topping all others in boasting   MENENIUS This is strange now Do you two know how you are censured     here in the city I mean of us o th righthand file Do you   BOTH TRIBUNES Why how are we censurd   MENENIUS Because you talk of pride now will you not be angry   BOTH TRIBUNES Well well sir well   MENENIUS Why tis no great matter for a very little thief of     occasion will rob you of a great deal of patience Give your     dispositions the reins and be angry at your pleasures at the     least if you take it as a pleasure to you in being so You blame     Marcius for being proud   BRUTUS We do it not alone sir   MENENIUS I know you can do very little alone for your helps are     many or else your actions would grow wondrous single your     abilities are too infantlike for doing much alone You talk of     pride O that you could turn your eyes toward the napes of your     necks and make but an interior survey of your good selves O     that you could   BOTH TRIBUNES What then sir   MENENIUS Why then you should discover a brace of unmeriting     proud violent testy magistratesalias fools as any in Rome   SICINIUS Menenius you are known well enough too   MENENIUS I am known to be a humorous patrician and one that loves     a cup of hot wine with not a drop of allaying Tiber int said to     be something imperfect in favouring the first complaint hasty     and tinderlike upon too trivial motion one that converses more     with the buttock of the night than with the forehead of the     morning What I think I utter and spend my malice in my breath     Meeting two such wealsmen as you are I cannot call you     Lycurguses if the drink you give me touch my palate adversely I     make a crooked face at it I cannot say your worships have     deliverd the matter well when I find the ass in compound with     the major part of your syllables and though I must be content to     bear with those that say you are reverend grave men yet they lie     deadly that tell you you have good faces If you see this in the     map of my microcosm follows it that I am known well enough too     What harm can your bisson conspectuities glean out of this     character if I be known well enough too   BRUTUS Come sir come we know you well enough   MENENIUS You know neither me yourselves nor any thing You are     ambitious for poor knaves caps and legs you wear out a good     wholesome forenoon in hearing a cause between an orangewife and     a fossetseller and then rejourn the controversy of threepence     to a second day of audience When you are hearing a matter     between party and party if you chance to be pinchd with the     colic you make faces like mummers set up the bloody flag     against all patience and in roaring for a chamberpot dismiss     the controversy bleeding the more entangled by your hearing All     the peace you make in their cause is calling both the parties     knaves You are a pair of strange ones   BRUTUS Come come you are well understood to be a perfecter giber     for the table than a necessary bencher in the Capitol   MENENIUS Our very priests must become mockers if they shall     encounter such ridiculous subjects as you are When you speak     best unto the purpose it is not worth the wagging of your     beards and your beards deserve not so honourable a grave as to     stuff a botchers cushion or to be entombd in an asss     packsaddle Yet you must be saying Marcius is proud who in a     cheap estimation is worth all your predecessors since Deucalion     though peradventure some of the best of em were hereditary     hangmen Godden to your worships More of your conversation     would infect my brain being the herdsmen of the beastly     plebeians I

OFFICER Three they say but tis thought of every one     Coriolanus will carry it   FIRST OFFICER Thats a brave fellow but hes vengeance proud and     loves not the common people   SECOND OFFICER Faith there have been many great men that have     flatterd the people who neer loved them and there be many     that they have loved they know not wherefore so that if they     love they know not why they hate upon no better a ground     Therefore for Coriolanus neither to care whether they love or     hate him manifests the true knowledge he has in their     disposition and out of his noble carelessness lets them plainly     seet   FIRST OFFICER If he did not care whether he had their love or no     he waved indifferently twixt doing them neither good nor harm     but he seeks their hate with greater devotion than they can     render it him and leaves nothing undone that may fully discover     him their opposite Now to seem to affect the malice and     displeasure of the people is as bad as that which he dislikes to     flatter them for their love   SECOND OFFICER He hath deserved worthily of his country and his     ascent is not by such easy degrees as those who having been     supple and courteous to the people bonneted without any further     deed to have them at all into their estimation and report but     he hath so planted his honours in their eyes and his actions in     their hearts that for their tongues to be silent and not confess     so much were a kind of ingrateful injury to report otherwise     were a malice that giving itself the lie would pluck reproof     and rebuke from every car that heard it   FIRST OFFICER No more of him hes a worthy man Make way they     are coming           A sennet Enter the PATRICIANS and the TRIBUNES          OF THE PEOPLE LICTORS before them CORIOLANUS             MENENIUS COMINIUS the Consul SICINIUS and                BRUTUS take their places by themselves                          CORIOLANUS stands    MENENIUS Having

please you     Most reverend and grave elders to desire     The present consul and last general     In our wellfound successes to report     A little of that worthy work performd     By Caius Marcius

Cominius speak   BRUTUS Most willingly     But yet my caution was more pertinent     Than the rebuke you give it   MENENIUS He loves your people     But tie him not to be their bedfellow     Worthy

stay I fled from words     You soothd not therefore hurt not But your people     I love them as they weigh   MENENIUS Pray now sit down   CORIOLANUS I had rather have one scratch my head i th sun     When the alarum were struck than idly sit     To hear my nothings monsterd                          Exit   MENENIUS Masters of the people     Your multiplying spawn how can he flatter     Thats thousand to one good one when you now see     He had rather venture all his limbs for honour     Than one ons ears to hear it Proceed Cominius   COMINIUS I shall lack voice the deeds of Coriolanus     Should not be utterd feebly It is held     That valour is the chiefest virtue and     Most dignifies the haver If it be     The man I speak of cannot in the world     Be singly counterpoisd At sixteen years     When Tarquin made a head for Rome he fought     Beyond the mark of others our then Dictator     Whom with all praise I point at saw him fight     When with his Amazonian chin he drove     The bristled lips before him he bestrid     An oerpressd Roman and i th consuls view     Slew three opposers Tarquins self he met     And struck him on his knee In that days feats     When he might act the woman in the scene     He provd best man i th field and for his meed     Was browbound with the oak His pupil age     Manentred thus he waxed like a sea     And in the brunt of seventeen battles since     He lurchd all swords of the garland For this last     Before and in Corioli let me say     I cannot speak him home He stoppd the fliers     And by his rare example made the coward     Turn terror into sport as weeds before     A vessel under sail so men obeyd     And fell below his stem His sword deaths stamp     Where it did mark it took from face to foot     He was a thing of blood whose every motion     Was timd with dying cries Alone he entred     The mortal gate of th city which he painted     With shunless destiny aidless came off     And with a sudden reenforcement struck     Corioli like a planet Now alls his     When by and by the din of war gan pierce     His ready sense then straight his doubled spirit     Requickned what in flesh was fatigate     And to the battle came he where he did     Run reeking oer the lives of men as if     Twere a perpetual spoil and till we calld     Both field and city ours he never stood     To ease his breast with panting   MENENIUS Worthy man   FIRST SENATOR He cannot but with measure fit the honours     Which we devise him   COMINIUS Our spoils he kickd at     And lookd upon things precious as they were     The common muck of the world He covets less     Than misery itself would give rewards     His deeds with doing them and is content     To spend the time to end it   MENENIUS Hes right noble     Let him be calld

you Was not this mockery   SICINIUS Why either were you ignorant to seet     Or seeing it of such childish friendliness     To yield your voices   BRUTUS Could you not have told him     As you were lessond when he had no power     But was a petty servant to the state     He was your enemy ever spake against     Your liberties and the charters that you bear     I th body of the weal and now arriving     A place of potency and sway o th state     If he should still malignantly remain     Fast foe to th plebeii your voices might     Be curses to yourselves You should have said     That as his worthy deeds did claim no less     Than what he stood for so his gracious nature     Would think upon you for your voices and     Translate his malice towards you into love     Standing your friendly lord   SICINIUS Thus to have said     As you were foreadvisd had touchd his spirit     And tried his inclination from him pluckd     Either his gracious promise which you might     As cause had calld you up have held him to     Or else it would have galld his surly nature     Which easily endures not article     Tying him to aught So putting him to rage     You should have taen th advantage of his choler     And passd him unelected   BRUTUS Did you perceive     He did solicit you in free contempt     When he did need your loves and do you think     That his contempt shall not be bruising to you     When he hath power to crush Why had your bodies     No heart among you Or had you tongues to cry     Against the rectorship of judgment   SICINIUS Have you     Ere now denied

them take     Their liberties make them of no more voice     Than dogs that are as often beat for barking     As therefore kept to do so   SICINIUS Let them assemble     And on a safer judgment all revoke     Your ignorant election Enforce his pride     And his old hate unto you besides forget not     With what contempt he wore the humble weed     How in his suit he scornd you but your loves     Thinking upon his services took from you     Th apprehension of his present portance     Which most gibingly ungravely he did fashion     After the inveterate hate he bears you   BRUTUS Lay     A fault on us your tribunes that we labourd     No impediment between but that you must     Cast your election on him   SICINIUS Say you chose him     More after our commandment than as guided     By your own true affections and that your minds     Preoccupied with what you rather must do     Than what you should made you against the grain     To voice him consul Lay the fault on us   BRUTUS Ay spare us not Say we read lectures to you     How youngly he began to serve his country     How long continued and what stock he springs of     The noble house o th Marcians from whence came     That Ancus Marcius Numas daughters son     Who after great Hostilius here was king     Of the same house Publius and Quintus were     That our best water brought by conduits hither     And Censorinus nobly named so     Twice being by the people chosen censor     Was his great ancestor   SICINIUS One thus descended     That hath beside well in his person wrought     To be set high in place we did commend     To your remembrances but you have found     Scaling his present bearing with his past     That hes your fixed enemy and revoke     Your sudden approbation   BRUTUS Say you neer had donet     Harp on that still but by our putting on     And presently when you have drawn your number     Repair to th Capitol   CITIZENS will will so almost all     Repent in their election                   Exeunt

   The vantage of his anger   SICINIUS To th Capitol come     We will be there before the stream o th people     And this shall seem as partly tis their own     Which we have goaded onward

heart prompts you     But with such words that are but roted in     Your tongue though but bastards and syllables     Of no allowance to your bosoms truth     Now this no more dishonours you at all     Than to take in a town with gentle words     Which else would put you to your fortune and     The hazard of much blood     I would dissemble with my nature where     My fortunes and my friends at

armd knees     Who bowd but in my stirrup bend like his     That hath receivd an alms I will not dot     Lest I surcease to honour mine own truth     And by my bodys action teach my mind     A most

Be good to Rome they chargd him even     As those should do that had deservd his hate     And therein showd fike enemies   MENENIUS Tis true     If he were putting to my house the brand     That

unwholesome when you cast     Your stinking greasy caps in hooting at     Coriolanus exile Now hes coming     And not a hair upon a soldiers head     Which will not prove a whip as many coxcombs     As you threw caps up will he tumble down     And pay you for your voices Tis no matter     If he could burn us all into one coal     We have deservd it   PLEBEIANS Faith we hear fearful news   FIRST CITIZEN For mine own part     When I said banish him I said twas pity   SECOND CITIZEN And so did I   THIRD CITIZEN And so did I and to say the truth so did very     many of us That we did we did for

AUFIDIUS Do they still fly to th Roman   LIEUTENANT I do not know what witchcrafts in him but     Your soldiers use him as the grace fore meat     Their talk at table and their thanks at end     And you are darkned in this action sir     Even by your own   AUFIDIUS I cannot help it now     Unless by using means I lame the foot     Of our design He bears himself more proudlier     Even to my person than I thought he would     When first I did embrace him yet his nature     In thats no changeling and I must excuse     What cannot be amended   LIEUTENANT Yet I wish sir     I mean for your particular you had not     Joind in commission with him but either     Had borne the action of yourself or else     To him had left it solely   AUFIDIUS I understand thee well and be thou sure     When he shall come to his account he knows not     What I can urge against him Although it seems     And so he thinks and is no less apparent     To th vulgar eye that he bears all things fairly     And shows good husbandry for the Volscian state     Fights dragonlike and does achieve as soon     As draw his sword yet he hath left undone     That which shall break his neck or hazard mine     Wheneer we come to our account   LIEUTENANT Sir I beseech you think you hell carry Rome   AUFIDIUS All places yield to him ere he sits down     And the nobility of Rome are his     The senators and patricians love him too     The tribunes are no soldiers and their people     Will be as rash in the repeal as hasty     To expel him thence I think hell be to Rome     As is the osprey to the fish who takes it     By sovereignty of nature First he was     A noble servant to them but he could not     Carry his honours even Whether twas pride     Which out of daily fortune ever taints     The happy man whether defect of judgment     To fail in the disposing of those chances     Which he was lord of or whether nature     Not to be other than one thing not moving     From th casque to th cushion but commanding peace     Even with the same austerity and garb     As he controlld the war but one of these     As he hath spices of them all not all     For I dare so far free him made him feard     So hated and so banishd But he has a merit     To choke it in the uttrance So our virtues     Lie in th interpretation of the time     And power unto itself most commendable     Hath not a tomb so evident as a chair     T extol what it hath done     One fire drives out one fire one nail one nail     Rights by rights falter strengths by strengths do fail     Come lets away When Caius Rome is thine     Thou art poorst of all then shortly art thou mine                                                           Exeunt  ACT V SCENE I Rome A public place  Enter MENENIUS COMINIUS SICINIUS and BRUTUS the two Tribunes with others    MENENIUS No Ill not go You hear what he hath said     Which was sometime his general who lovd him     In a most dear particular He calld me father     But what o that Go you that banishd him     A mile before his tent fall down and knee     The way into his mercy Nay if he coyd     To hear Cominius speak Ill keep at home   COMINIUS He would not seem to know me   MENENIUS Do you hear   COMINIUS Yet one time he did call me by my name     I urgd our old acquaintance and the drops     That we have bled together Coriolanus     He would not answer to forbid all names     He was a kind of nothing titleless     Till he had forgd himself a name i th fire     Of burning Rome   MENENIUS Why so You have made good work     A pair of tribunes that have wrackd for Rome     To make coals cheap a noble memory   COMINIUS I minded him how royal twas to pardon     When it was less expected he replied     It was a bare petition of a state     To one whom they had punishd   MENENIUS Very well     Could he say less   COMINIUS I offerd to awaken his regard     Fors private friends his answer to me was     He could not stay to pick them in a pile     Of noisome musty chaff He said twas folly     For one poor grain or two to leave unburnt     And still to nose th offence   MENENIUS For one poor grain or two     I am one of those His mother wife his child     And this brave fellow too we are the grains     You are the musty chaff and you are smelt     Above the moon We must be burnt for you   SICINIUS Nay pray be patient if you refuse your aid     In this so neverneeded help yet do not     Upbraids with our distress But sure if you     Would be your countrys pleader your good tongue     More than the instant army we can make     Might stop our countryman   MENENIUS No Ill not meddle   SICINIUS Pray you go to him   MENENIUS What should I do   BRUTUS Only make trial what your love can do     For Rome towards Marcius   MENENIUS Well and say that Marcius     Return me as Cominius is returnd     Unheard what then     But as a discontented friend griefshot     With his unkindness Sayt be so   SICINIUS Yet your good will     Must have that thanks from Rome after the measure     As you intended well   MENENIUS Ill undertaket     I think hell hear me Yet to bite his lip     And hum at good Cominius much unhearts me     He was not taken well he had not dind     The veins unfilld our blood is cold and then     We pout upon the morning are unapt     To give or to forgive but when we have stuffd     These pipes and these conveyances of our blood     With wine and feeding we have suppler souls     Than in our priestlike fasts Therefore Ill watch him     Till he be dieted to my request     And then Ill set upon him   BRUTUS You know the very road into his kindness     And cannot lose your way   MENENIUS Good faith Ill prove him     Speed how it will I shall ere long have knowledge     Of my success                                          Exit   COMINIUS Hell never hear him   SICINIUS Not   COMINIUS I tell you he does sit in gold his eye     Red as twould burn Rome and his injury     The gaoler to his pity I kneeld before him     Twas very faintly he said Rise dismissd me     Thus with his speechless hand What he would do     He sent in writing after me what he would not     Bound with an oath to yield to his conditions     So that all hope is vain     Unless his noble mother and his wife     Who as I hear mean to solicit him     For mercy to his country Therefore lets hence     And with our fair entreaties haste them on           Exeunt  SCENE II The Volscian camp before Rome  Enter MENENIUS to the WATCH on guard    FIRST WATCH Stay Whence are you   SECOND WATCH Stand and go back   MENENIUS You guard like men tis

blest     For making up this peace Thou knowst great son     The end of wars uncertain but this certain     That if thou conquer Rome the benefit     Which thou shalt thereby reap is such a name     Whose repetition will be doggd with curses     Whose chronicle thus writ The man was noble     But with his last attempt he wipd it out     Destroyd his country and his name remains     To th ensuing age abhorrd Speak to me son     Thou hast affected the fine strains of honour     To imitate the graces of the gods     To tear with thunder the wide cheeks o th air     And yet to charge thy sulphur with a bolt     That should but rive an oak Why dost not speak     Thinkst thou it honourable for a noble man     Still to remember wrongs Daughter speak you     He cares not for your weeping Speak thou boy     Perhaps thy childishness will move him more     Than can our reasons Theres no man in the world     More bound tos mother yet here he lets me prate     Like one i th stocks Thou hast never in thy life     Showd thy dear mother any courtesy     When she poor hen fond of no second brood     Has cluckd thee to the wars and safely home     Loaden with honour Say my requests unjust     And spurn me back but if it he not so     Thou art not honest and the gods will plague thee     That thou restrainst from me the duty which     To a mothers part belongs He turns away     Down ladies let us shame him with our knees     To his surname Coriolanus longs more pride     Than pity to our prayers Down An end     This is the last So we will home to Rome     And die among our neighbours Nay beholds     This boy that cannot tell what he would have     But kneels and holds up hands for fellowship     Does reason our petition with more strength     Than thou hast to denyt Come let us go

They laugh at O my mother mother O     You have won a happy victory to Rome     But for your son believe it O believe it     Most dangerously you have with him prevaild     If not most mortal to him But let it come     Aufidius though I cannot make true wars     Ill frame convenient peace Now good Aufidius     Were you in my stead would you have heard     A mother less or granted less Aufidius

the catalogue of his endowments had been tabled by his side and I to peruse him by items  PHILARIO You speak of him when he was less furnishd than now he is with that which makes him both without and within  FRENCHMAN I have seen him in France we had very many there could behold the sun with as firm eyes as he  IACHIMO This matter of marrying his kings daughter wherein he must be weighed rather by her value than his own words him I doubt not a great deal from the matter  FRENCHMAN And then his banishment  IACHIMO Ay and the approbation of those that weep this lamentable divorce under her colours are wonderfully to extend him be it but to fortify her judgement which else an easy battery might lay flat for taking a beggar without less quality But how comes it he is to sojourn with you

guided by others experiences but upon my mended judgement if I offend not to say it is mended my quarrel was not altogether slight  FRENCHMAN Faith yes to be put to the arbitrement of swords and by such two that would by all likelihood have confounded one the other or have falln both  IACHIMO Can we with manners ask what was the difference  FRENCHMAN Safely I think Twas a contention in public which may without contradiction suffer the report It was much like an argument that fell out last night where each of us fell in praise of our country mistresses this gentleman at that time vouching and upon warrant of bloody affirmation his to be more fair virtuous wise chaste constant qualified and less attemptable than any the rarest of our ladies in France  IACHIMO That lady is not now living

Dane  FRANCISCO Give you good night  MARCELLUS O farewell honest soldier who hath relievd you  FRANCISCO Barnardo has my place Give you goodnight   Exit  MARCELLUS Holla Barnardo  BARNARDO Say what is Horatio there  HORATIO A piece of him  BARNARDO Welcome Horatio Welcome good Marcellus  MARCELLUS What has this thing appeard again tonight  BARNARDO I have seen nothing  MARCELLUS Horatio says tis but our fantasy And will not let belief take hold of him Touching this dreaded sight twice seen of us Therefore I have entreated him along With us to watch the minutes of this night That if again this apparition come He may approve our eyes and speak to it  HORATIO Tush tush twill not appear  BARNARDO Sit down awhile And let us once again assail your ears That are so fortified against our story What we two nights have seen  HORATIO Well sit we down And let us hear Barnardo speak of this  BARNARDO Last night of all When yond same star thats westward from the pole Had made his course tillume that part of heaven Where now it burns Marcellus and myself The bell then beating one  MARCELLUS Peace break thee off Look where it comes again   Enter Ghost  BARNARDO In the same figure like the King thats dead  MARCELLUS Thou art a scholar speak to it Horatio  BARNARDO Looks it not like the King Mark it Horatio  HORATIO Most like It harrows me with fear and wonder  BARNARDO It would be spoke to  MARCELLUS Question it Horatio  HORATIO What art thou that usurpst this time of night Together with that fair and warlike form In which the majesty of buried Denmark Did sometimes march By heaven I charge thee speak  MARCELLUS It is offended  BARNARDO See it stalks away  HORATIO Stay speak speak I charge thee speak   Exit Ghost  MARCELLUS Tis gone and will not answer  BARNARDO How now Horatio You tremble and look pale Is not this something more than fantasy What think you ont  HORATIO Before my God I might not this believe Without the sensible and true avouch Of mine own eyes  MARCELLUS Is it not like the King  HORATIO As thou art to thyself Such was the very armour he had on When he thambitious Norway combated So frownd he once when in an angry parle He smote the sledded Polacks on the ice Tis strange  MARCELLUS Thus twice before and jump at this dead hour With martial stalk hath he gone by our watch  HORATIO In what particular thought to work I know not But in the gross and scope of my opinion This bodes some strange eruption to our state  MARCELLUS Good now sit down and tell me he that knows Why this same strict and most observant watch So nightly toils the subject of the land And why such daily cast of brazen cannon And foreign mart for implements of war Why such impress of shipwrights whose sore task Does not divide the Sunday from the week What might be toward that this sweaty haste Doth make the night jointlabourer with the day Who ist that can inform me  HORATIO That can I At least the whisper goes so Our last King Whose image even but now appeard to us Was as you know by Fortinbras of Norway Thereto prickd on by a most emulate pride Dard to the combat in which our valiant Hamlet For so this side of our known world esteemd him Did slay this Fortinbras who by a seald compact Well ratified by law and heraldry Did forfeit with his life all those his lands Which he stood seizd of to the conqueror Against the which a moiety competent Was gaged by our King which had returnd To the inheritance of Fortinbras Had he been vanquisher as by the same covnant And carriage of the article designd His fell to Hamlet Now sir young Fortinbras Of unimproved mettle hot and full Hath in the skirts of Norway here and there Sharkd up a list of lawless resolutes For food and diet to some enterprise That hath a stomach int which is no other As it doth well appear unto our state But to recover of us by strong hand And terms compulsatory those foresaid lands So by his father lost And this I take it Is the main motive of our preparations The source of this our watch and the chief head Of this posthaste and rummage in the land  BARNARDO I think it be no other but een so Well may it sort that this portentous figure Comes armed through our watch so like the King That was and is the question of these wars  HORATIO A mote it is to trouble the minds eye In the most high and palmy state of Rome A little ere the mightiest Julius fell The graves stood tenantless and the sheeted dead Did squeak and gibber in the Roman streets As stars with trains of fire and dews of blood Disasters in the sun and the moist star Upon whose influence Neptunes empire stands Was sick almost to doomsday with eclipse And even the like precurse of fierce events As harbingers preceding still the fates And prologue to the omen coming on Have heaven and earth together demonstrated Unto our climatures and countrymen   Reenter Ghost  But soft behold Lo where it comes again Ill cross it though it blast me Stay illusion If thou hast any sound or use of voice Speak to me If there be any good thing to be done That may to thee do ease and grace to me Speak to me If thou art privy to thy countrys fate Which happily foreknowing may avoid O speak Or if thou hast uphoarded in thy life Extorted treasure in the womb of earth For which they say you spirits oft walk in death Speak of it Stay and speak   The cock crows  Stop it Marcellus  MARCELLUS Shall I strike at it with my partisan  HORATIO Do if it will not stand  BARNARDO Tis here  HORATIO Tis here   Exit Ghost  MARCELLUS Tis gone We do it wrong being so majestical To offer it the show of violence For it is as the air invulnerable And our vain blows malicious mockery  BARNARDO It was about to speak when the cock crew  HORATIO And then it started like a guilty thing Upon a fearful summons I have heard The cock that is the trumpet to the morn Doth with his lofty and shrillsounding throat Awake the god of day and at his warning Whether in sea or fire in earth or air Thextravagant and erring spirit hies To his confine And of the truth herein This present object made probation  MARCELLUS It faded on the crowing of the cock Some say that ever gainst that season comes Wherein our Saviours birth is celebrated The bird of dawning singeth all night long And then they say no spirit dare stir abroad The nights are wholesome then no planets strike No fairy takes nor witch hath power to charm So hallowd and so gracious is the time  HORATIO So have I heard and do in part believe it But look the morn in russet mantle clad Walks oer the dew of yon high eastward hill Break we our watch up and by my advice Let us impart what we have seen tonight Unto young Hamlet for upon my life This spirit dumb to us will speak to him Do you consent we shall acquaint him with it As needful in our loves fitting our duty  MARCELLUS Lets dot I pray and I this morning know Where we shall find him most conveniently   Exeunt  SCENE II Elsinore A room of state in the Castle   Enter Claudius King of Denmark Gertrude the Queen Hamlet Polonius  Laertes Voltemand Cornelius Lords and Attendant  KING Though yet of Hamlet our dear brothers death The memory be green and that it us befitted To bear our hearts in grief and our whole kingdom To be contracted in one brow of woe Yet so far hath discretion fought with nature That we with wisest sorrow think on him Together with remembrance of ourselves Therefore our sometime sister now our queen Thimperial jointress to this warlike state Have we as twere with a defeated joy With one auspicious and one dropping eye With mirth in funeral and with dirge in marriage In equal scale weighing delight and dole Taken to wife nor have we herein barrd Your better wisdoms which have freely gone With this affair along For all our thanks Now follows that you know young Fortinbras Holding a weak supposal of our worth Or thinking by our late dear brothers death Our state to be disjoint and out of frame Colleagued with this dream of his advantage He hath not faild to pester us with message Importing the surrender of those lands Lost by his father with all bonds of law To our most valiant brother So much for him Now for ourself and for this time of meeting Thus much the business is we have here writ To Norway uncle of young Fortinbras Who impotent and bedrid scarcely hears Of this his nephews purpose to suppress His further gait herein in that the levies The lists and full proportions are all made Out of his subject and we here dispatch You good Cornelius and you Voltemand For bearers of this greeting to old Norway Giving to you no further personal power To business with the King more than the scope Of these dilated articles allow Farewell and let your haste commend your duty  CORNELIUS and VOLTEMAND In that and all things will we show our duty  KING We doubt it nothing heartily farewell   Exeunt Voltemand and Cornelius  And now Laertes whats the news with you You told us of some suit What ist Laertes You cannot speak of reason to the Dane And lose your voice What wouldst thou beg Laertes That shall not be my offer not thy asking The head is not more native to the heart The hand more instrumental to the mouth Than is the throne of Denmark to thy father What wouldst thou have Laertes  LAERTES Dread my lord Your leave and favour to return to France From whence though willingly I came to Denmark To show my duty in your coronation Yet now I must confess that duty done My thoughts and wishes bend again toward France And bow them to your gracious leave and pardon  KING Have you your fathers leave What says Polonius  POLONIUS He hath my lord wrung from me my slow leave By laboursome petition and at last Upon his will I seald my hard consent I do beseech you give him leave to go  KING Take thy fair hour Laertes time be thine And thy best graces spend it at thy will But now my cousin Hamlet and my son  HAMLET Aside A little more than kin and less than kind  KING How is it that the clouds still hang on you  HAMLET Not so my lord I am too much i the sun  QUEEN Good Hamlet cast thy nighted colour off And let thine eye look like a friend on Denmark Do not for ever with thy vailed lids Seek for thy noble father in the dust Thou knowst tis common all that lives must die Passing through nature to eternity  HAMLET Ay madam it is common  QUEEN If it be Why seems it so particular with thee  HAMLET Seems madam Nay it is I know not seems Tis not alone my inky cloak good mother Nor customary suits of solemn black Nor windy suspiration of forcd breath No nor the fruitful river in the eye Nor the dejected haviour of the visage Together with all forms moods shows of grief That can denote me truly These indeed seem For they are actions that a man might play But I have that within which passeth show These but the trappings and the suits of woe  KING Tis sweet and commendable in your nature Hamlet To give these mourning duties to your father But you must know your father lost a father That father lost lost his and the survivor bound In filial obligation for some term To do obsequious sorrow But to persevere In obstinate condolement is a course Of impious stubbornness Tis unmanly grief It shows a will most incorrect to heaven A heart unfortified a mind impatient An understanding simple and unschoold For what we know must be and is as common As any the most vulgar thing to sense Why should we in our peevish opposition Take it to heart Fie tis a fault to heaven A fault against the dead a fault to nature To reason most absurd whose common theme Is death of fathers and who still hath cried From the first corse till he that died today This must be so We pray you throw to earth This unprevailing woe and think of us As of a father for let the world take note You are the most immediate to our throne And with no less nobility of love Than that which dearest father bears his son Do I impart toward you For your intent In going back to school in Wittenberg It is most retrograde to our desire And we beseech you bend you to remain Here in the cheer and comfort of our eye Our chiefest courtier cousin and our son  QUEEN Let not thy mother lose her prayers Hamlet I pray thee stay with us go not to Wittenberg  HAMLET I shall in all my best obey you madam  KING Why tis a loving and a fair reply Be as ourself in Denmark Madam come This gentle and unforcd accord of Hamlet Sits smiling to my heart in grace whereof No jocund health that Denmark drinks today But the great cannon to the clouds shall tell And the Kings rouse the heaven shall bruit again Respeaking earthly thunder Come away   Exeunt all but Hamlet  HAMLET O that this too too solid flesh would melt Thaw and resolve itself into a dew Or that the Everlasting had not fixd His canon gainst selfslaughter O God O God How weary stale flat and unprofitable Seem to me all the uses of this world Fie ont Oh fie tis an unweeded garden That grows to seed things rank and gross in nature Possess it merely That it should come to this But two months deadnay not so much not two So excellent a king that was to this Hyperion to a satyr so loving to my mother That he might not beteem the winds of heaven Visit her face too roughly Heaven and earth Must I remember Why she would hang on him As if increase of appetite had grown By what it fed on and yet within a month Let me not think ontFrailty thy name is woman A little month or ere those shoes were old With which she followed my poor fathers body Like Niobe all tearsWhy she even she O God A beast that wants discourse of reason Would have mournd longermarried with mine uncle My fathers brother but no more like my father Than I to Hercules Within a month Ere yet the salt of most unrighteous tears Had left the flushing in her galled eyes She married O most wicked speed to post With such dexterity to incestuous sheets It is not nor it cannot come to good But break my heart for I must hold my tongue   Enter Horatio Marcellus and Barnardo  HORATIO Hail to your lordship  HAMLET I am glad to see you well Horatio or I do forget myself  HORATIO The same my lord And your poor servant ever  HAMLET Sir my good friend Ill change that name with you And what make you from Wittenberg Horatio Marcellus  MARCELLUS My good lord  HAMLET I am very glad to see youGood even sir But what in faith make you from Wittenberg  HORATIO A truant disposition good my lord  HAMLET I would not hear your enemy say so Nor shall you do my ear that violence To make it truster of your own report Against yourself I know you are no truant But what is your affair in Elsinore Well teach you to drink deep ere you depart  HORATIO My lord I came to see your fathers funeral  HAMLET I prithee do not mock me fellowstudent I think it was to see my mothers wedding  HORATIO Indeed my lord it followd hard upon  HAMLET Thrift thrift Horatio The funeral bakd meats Did coldly furnish forth the marriage tables Would I had met my dearest foe in heaven Or ever I had seen that day Horatio My fathermethinks I see my father  HORATIO Where my lord  HAMLET In my minds eye Horatio  HORATIO I saw him once he was a goodly king  HAMLET He was a man take him for all in all I shall not look upon his like again  HORATIO My lord I think I saw him yesternight  HAMLET Saw Who  HORATIO My lord the King your father  HAMLET The King my father  HORATIO Season your admiration for a while With an attent ear till I may deliver Upon the witness of these gentlemen This marvel to you  HAMLET For Gods love let me hear  HORATIO Two nights together had these gentlemen Marcellus and Barnardo on their watch In the dead waste and middle of the night Been thus encounterd A figure like your father Armed at point exactly cappie Appears before them and with solemn march Goes slow and stately by them thrice he walkd By their oppressd and fearsurprised eyes Within his truncheons length whilst they distilld Almost to jelly with the act of fear Stand dumb and speak not to him This to me In dreadful secrecy impart they did And I with them the third night kept the watch Where as they had deliverd both in time Form of the thing each word made true and good The apparition comes I knew your father These hands are not more like  HAMLET But where was this  MARCELLUS My lord upon the platform where we watch  HAMLET Did you not speak to it  HORATIO My lord I did But answer made it none yet once methought It lifted up it head and did address Itself to motion like as it would speak But even then the morning cock crew loud And at the sound it shrunk in haste away And vanishd from our sight  HAMLET Tis very strange  HORATIO As I do live my honourd lord tis true And we did think it writ down in our duty To let you know of it  HAMLET Indeed indeed sirs but this troubles me Hold you the watch tonight  Mar and BARNARDO We do my lord  HAMLET Armd say you  Both Armd my lord  HAMLET From top to toe  BOTH My lord from head to foot  HAMLET Then saw you not his face  HORATIO O yes my lord he wore his beaver up  HAMLET What lookd he frowningly  HORATIO A countenance more in sorrow than in anger  HAMLET Pale or red  HORATIO Nay very pale  HAMLET And fixd his eyes upon you  HORATIO Most constantly  HAMLET I would I had been there  HORATIO It would have much amazd you  HAMLET Very like very like Stayd it long  HORATIO While one with moderate haste might tell a hundred  MARCELLUS and BARNARDO Longer longer  HORATIO Not when I sawt  HAMLET His beard was grizzled no  HORATIO It was as I have seen it in his life A sable silverd  HAMLET I will watch tonight Perchance twill walk again  HORATIO I warrant you it will  HAMLET If it assume my noble fathers person Ill speak to it though hell itself should gape And bid me hold my peace I pray you all If you have hitherto conceald this sight Let it be tenable in your silence still And whatsoever else shall hap tonight Give it an understanding but no tongue I will requite your loves So fare ye well Upon the platform twixt eleven and twelve Ill visit you  ALL Our duty to your honour  HAMLET Your loves as mine to you farewell   Exeunt Horatio Marcellus and Barnardo  My fathers spirit in arms All is not well I doubt some foul play would the night were come Till then sit still my soul foul deeds will rise Though all the earth oerwhelm them to mens eyes   Exit  SCENE III A room in Poloniuss house   Enter Laertes and Ophelia  LAERTES My necessaries are embarkd Farewell And sister as the winds give benefit And convoy is assistant do not sleep But let me hear from you  OPHELIA Do you doubt that  LAERTES For Hamlet and the trifling of his favour Hold it a fashion and a toy in blood A violet in the youth of primy nature Forward not permanent sweet not lasting The perfume and suppliance of a minute No more  OPHELIA No more but so  LAERTES Think it no more For nature crescent does not grow alone In thews and bulk but as this temple waxes The inward service of the mind and soul Grows wide withal Perhaps he loves you now And now no soil nor cautel doth besmirch The virtue of his will but you must fear His greatness weighd his will is not his own For he himself is subject to his birth He may not as unvalud persons do Carve for himself for on his choice depends The sanctity and health of this whole state And therefore must his choice be circumscribd Unto the voice and yielding of that body Whereof he is the head Then if he says he loves you It fits your wisdom so far to believe it As he in his particular act and place May give his saying deed which is no further Than the main voice of Denmark goes withal Then weigh what loss your honour may sustain If with too credent ear you list his songs Or lose your heart or your chaste treasure open To his unmasterd importunity Fear it Ophelia fear it my dear sister And keep you in the rear of your affection Out of the shot and danger of desire The chariest maid is prodigal enough If she unmask her beauty to the moon Virtue itself scopes not calumnious strokes The canker galls the infants of the spring Too oft before their buttons be disclosd And in the morn and liquid dew of youth Contagious blastments are most imminent Be wary then best safety lies in fear Youth to itself rebels though none else near  OPHELIA I shall theffect of this good lesson keep As watchman to my heart But good my brother Do not as some ungracious pastors do Show me the steep and thorny way to heaven Whilst like a puffd and reckless libertine Himself the primrose path of dalliance treads And recks not his own rede  LAERTES O fear me not I stay too long But here my father comes   Enter Polonius  A double blessing is a double grace Occasion smiles upon a second leave  POLONIUS Yet here Laertes Aboard aboard for shame The wind sits in the shoulder of your sail And you are stayd for There my blessing with you   Laying his hand on Laertess head  And these few precepts in thy memory Look thou character Give thy thoughts no tongue Nor any unproportiond thought his act Be thou familiar but by no means vulgar Those friends thou hast and their adoption tried Grapple them unto thy soul with hoops of steel But do not dull thy palm with entertainment Of each newhatchd unfledgd comrade Beware Of entrance to a quarrel but being in Beart that thopposed may beware of thee Give every man thine ear but few thy voice Take each mans censure but reserve thy judgment Costly thy habit as thy purse can buy But not expressd in fancy rich not gaudy For the apparel oft proclaims the man And they in France of the best rank and station Are of a most select and generous chief in that Neither a borrower nor a lender be For loan oft loses both itself and friend And borrowing dulls the edge of husbandry This above all to thine own self be true And it must follow as the night the day Thou canst not then be false to any man Farewell my blessing season this in thee  LAERTES Most humbly do I take my leave my lord  POLONIUS The time invites you go your servants tend  LAERTES Farewell Ophelia and remember well What I have said to you  OPHELIA Tis in my memory lockd And you yourself shall keep the key of it  LAERTES Farewell   Exit  POLONIUS What ist Ophelia he hath said to you  OPHELIA So please you something touching the Lord Hamlet  POLONIUS Marry well bethought Tis told me he hath very oft of late Given private time to you and you yourself Have of your audience been most free and bounteous If it be soas so tis put on me And that in way of cautionI must tell you You do not understand yourself so clearly As it behoves my daughter and your honour What is between you Give me up the truth  OPHELIA He hath my lord of late made many tenders Of his affection to me  POLONIUS Affection Pooh You speak like a green girl Unsifted in such perilous circumstance Do you believe his tenders as you call them  OPHELIA I do not know my lord what I should think  POLONIUS Marry Ill teach you think yourself a baby That you have taen these tenders for true pay Which are not sterling Tender yourself more dearly Ornot to crack the wind of the poor phrase Roaming it thusyoull tender me a fool  OPHELIA My lord he hath importund me with love In honourable fashion  POLONIUS Ay fashion you may call it go to go to  OPHELIA And hath given countenance to his speech my lord With almost all the holy vows of heaven  POLONIUS Ay springes to catch woodcocks I do know When the blood burns how prodigal the soul Lends the tongue vows these blazes daughter Giving more light than heat extinct in both Even in their promise as it is amaking You must not take for fire From this time Be something scanter of your maiden presence Set your entreatments at a higher rate Than a command to parley For Lord Hamlet Believe so much in him that he is young And with a larger tether may he walk Than may be given you In few Ophelia Do not believe his vows for they are brokers Not of that dye which their investments show But mere implorators of unholy suits Breathing like sanctified and pious bawds The better to beguile This is for all I would not in plain terms from this time forth Have you so slander any moment leisure As to give words or talk with the Lord Hamlet Look tot I charge you come your ways  OPHELIA I shall obey my lord   Exeunt  SCENE IV The platform   Enter Hamlet Horatio and Marcellus  HAMLET The air bites shrewdly it is very cold  HORATIO It is a nipping and an eager air  HAMLET What hour now  HORATIO I think it lacks of twelve  MARCELLUS No it is struck  HORATIO Indeed I heard it not It then draws near the season Wherein the spirit held his wont to walk   A flourish of trumpets and ordnance shot off within  What does this mean my lord  HAMLET The King doth wake tonight and takes his rouse Keeps wassail and the swaggering upspring reels And as he drains his draughts of Rhenish down The kettledrum and trumpet thus bray out The triumph of his pledge  HORATIO Is it a custom  HAMLET Ay marry ist And to my mind though I am native here And to the manner born it is a custom More honourd in the breach than the observance This heavyheaded revel east and west Makes us traducd and taxd of other nations They clepe us drunkards and with swinish phrase Soil our addition and indeed it takes From our achievements though performd at height The pith and marrow of our attribute So oft it chances in particular men That for some vicious mole of nature in them As in their birth wherein they are not guilty Since nature cannot choose his origin By their oergrowth of some complexion Oft breaking down the pales and forts of reason Or by some habit that too much oerleavens The form of plausive mannersthat these men Carrying I say the stamp of one defect Being Natures livery or Fortunes star His virtues elsebe they as pure as grace As infinite as man may undergo Shall in the general censure take corruption From that particular fault The dram of evil Doth all the noble substance often doubt To his own scandal  HORATIO Look my lord it comes   Enter Ghost  HAMLET Angels and ministers of grace defend us Be thou a spirit of health or goblin damnd Bring with thee airs from heaven or blasts from hell Be thy intents wicked or charitable Thou comst in such a questionable shape That I will speak to thee Ill call thee Hamlet King father royal Dane O answer me Let me not burst in ignorance but tell Why thy canonizd bones hearsed in death Have burst their cerements why the sepulchre Wherein we saw thee quietly inurnd Hath opd his ponderous and marble jaws To cast thee up again What may this mean That thou dead corse again in complete steel Revisitst thus the glimpses of the moon Making night hideous and we fools of nature So horridly to shake our disposition With thoughts beyond the reaches of our souls Say why is this Wherefore What should we do   Ghost beckons Hamlet  HORATIO It beckons you to go away with it As if it some impartment did desire To you alone  MARCELLUS Look with what courteous action It waves you to a more removed ground But do not go with it  HORATIO No by no means  HAMLET It will not speak then will I follow it  HORATIO Do not my lord  HAMLET Why what should be the fear I do not set my life at a pins fee And for my soul what can it do to that Being a thing immortal as itself It waves me forth again Ill follow it  HORATIO What if it tempt you toward the flood my lord Or to the dreadful summit of the cliff That beetles oer his base into the sea And there assume some other horrible form Which might deprive your sovereignty of reason And draw you into madness Think of it The very place puts toys of desperation Without more motive into every brain That looks so many fadoms to the sea And hears it roar beneath  HAMLET It waves me still Go on Ill follow thee  MARCELLUS You shall not go my lord  HAMLET Hold off your hands  HORATIO Be ruld you shall not go  HAMLET My fate cries out And makes each petty artery in this body As hardy as the Nemean lions nerve   Ghost beckons  Still am I calld Unhand me gentlemen   Breaking free from them  By heaven Ill make a ghost of him that lets me I say awayGo on Ill follow thee   Exeunt Ghost and Hamlet  HORATIO He waxes desperate with imagination  MARCELLUS Lets follow tis not fit thus to obey him  HORATIO Have after To what issue will this come  MARCELLUS Something is rotten in the state of Denmark  HORATIO Heaven will direct it  MARCELLUS Nay lets follow him   Exeunt  SCENE V A more remote part of the Castle   Enter Ghost and Hamlet  HAMLET Whither wilt thou lead me Speak Ill go no further  GHOST Mark me  HAMLET I will  GHOST My hour is almost come When I to sulphrous and tormenting flames Must render up myself  HAMLET Alas poor ghost  GHOST Pity me not but lend thy serious hearing To what I shall unfold  HAMLET Speak I am bound to hear  GHOST So art thou to revenge when thou shalt hear  HAMLET What  GHOST I am thy fathers spirit Doomd for a certain term to walk the night And for the day confind to fast in fires Till the foul crimes done in my days of nature Are burnt and purgd away But that I am forbid To tell the secrets of my prisonhouse I could a tale unfold whose lightest word Would harrow up thy soul freeze thy young blood Make thy two eyes like stars start from their spheres Thy knotted and combined locks to part And each particular hair to stand on end Like quills upon the fretful porcupine But this eternal blazon must not be To ears of flesh and blood List list O list If thou didst ever thy dear father love  HAMLET O God  GHOST Revenge his foul and most unnatural murder  HAMLET Murder  GHOST Murder most foul as in the best it is But this most foul strange and unnatural  HAMLET Haste me to knowt that I with wings as swift As meditation or the thoughts of love May sweep to my revenge  GHOST I find thee apt And duller shouldst thou be than the fat weed That rots itself in ease on Lethe wharf Wouldst thou not stir in this Now Hamlet hear Tis given out that sleeping in my orchard A serpent stung me so the whole ear of Denmark Is by a forged process of my death Rankly abusd but know thou noble youth The serpent that did sting thy fathers life Now wears his crown  HAMLET O my prophetic soul Mine uncle  GHOST Ay that incestuous that adulterate beast With witchcraft of his wit with traitorous gifts O wicked wit and gifts that have the power So to seducewon to his shameful lust The will of my most seemingvirtuous queen O Hamlet what a falling off was there From me whose love was of that dignity That it went hand in hand even with the vow I made to her in marriage and to decline Upon a wretch whose natural gifts were poor To those of mine But virtue as it never will be movd Though lewdness court it in a shape of heaven So lust though to a radiant angel linkd Will sate itself in a celestial bed And prey on garbage But soft methinks I scent the morning air Brief let me be Sleeping within my orchard My custom always of the afternoon Upon my secure hour thy uncle stole With juice of cursed hebenon in a vial And in the porches of my ears did pour The leperous distilment whose effect Holds such an enmity with blood of man That swift as quicksilver it courses through The natural gates and alleys of the body And with a sudden vigour it doth posset And curd like eager droppings into milk The thin and wholesome blood So did it mine And a most instant tetter barkd about Most lazarlike with vile and loathsome crust All my smooth body Thus was I sleeping by a brothers hand Of life of crown of queen at once dispatchd Cut off even in the blossoms of my sin Unhousled disappointed unaneld No reckoning made but sent to my account With all my imperfections on my head O horrible O horrible most horrible If thou hast nature in thee bear it not Let not the royal bed of Denmark be A couch for luxury and damned incest But howsoever thou pursust this act Taint not thy mind nor let thy soul contrive Against thy mother aught leave her to heaven And to those thorns that in her bosom lodge To prick and sting her Fare thee well at once The glowworm shows the matin to be near And gins to pale his uneffectual fire Adieu adieu adieu Hamlet remember me   Exit  HAMLET O all you host of heaven O earth What else And shall I couple hell O fie Hold my heart And you my sinews grow not instant old But bear me stiffly up Remember thee Ay thou poor ghost while memory holds a seat In this distracted globe Remember thee Yea from the table of my memory Ill wipe away all trivial fond records All saws of books all forms all pressures past That youth and observation copied there And thy commandment all alone shall live Within the book and volume of my brain Unmixd with baser matter Yes by heaven O most pernicious woman O villain villain smiling damned villain My tables Meet it is I set it down That one may smile and smile and be a villain At least I am sure it may be so in Denmark   Writing  So uncle there you are Now to my word It is Adieu adieu remember me I have swornt  HORATIO and MARCELLUS Within My lord my lord  MARCELLUS Within Lord Hamlet  HORATIO Within Heaven secure him  HAMLET So be it  MARCELLUS Within Illo ho ho my lord  HAMLET Hillo ho ho boy Come

all Denmark But hes an arrant knave  HORATIO There needs no ghost my lord come from the grave To tell us this  HAMLET Why right you are i the right And so without more circumstance at all I hold it fit that we shake hands and part You as your business and desires shall point you For every man hath business and desire Such as it isand for my own poor part Look you Ill go pray  HORATIO These are but wild and whirling words my lord  HAMLET Im sorry they offend you heartily Yes faith heartily  HORATIO Theres no offence my lord  HAMLET Yes by Saint Patrick but there is Horatio And much offence too Touching this vision here It is an honest ghost that let me tell you For your desire to know what is between us Oermastert as you may And now good friends As you are friends scholars and soldiers Give me one poor request  HORATIO What ist my lord We will  HAMLET Never make known what you have seen tonight  HORATIO and MARCELLUS My lord we will not  HAMLET Nay but sweart  HORATIO In faith my

Enquire me first what Danskers are in Paris And how and who what means and where they keep What company at what expense and finding By this encompassment and drift of question That they do know my son come you more nearer Than your particular demands will touch it Take you as twere some distant knowledge of him As thus I know his father and his friends And in part himdo you mark this Reynaldo  REYNALDO Ay very well my lord  POLONIUS And in part him but you may say not well But ift be he I mean hes very wild Addicted so and so and there put on him What forgeries you please marry none so rank As may dishonour him take heed of that But sir such wanton wild and usual slips As are companions noted and most known To youth and liberty  REYNALDO As gaming my lord  POLONIUS Ay or drinking fencing swearing Quarrelling drabbing You may go so far  REYNALDO My lord that would dishonour him  POLONIUS Faith no as you may season it in the charge You must not put another scandal on him That he is open to incontinency Thats not my meaning but breathe his faults so quaintly That they may seem the taints of liberty The flash and outbreak of a fiery mind A savageness in unreclaimed blood Of general assault  REYNALDO But my good lord  POLONIUS Wherefore should you do this  REYNALDO Ay my lord I would know that  POLONIUS Marry sir heres my drift And I believe it is a fetch of warrant You laying these slight sullies on my son As twere a thing a little soild i th working Mark you Your party in converse him you would sound Having ever seen in the prenominate crimes The youth you breathe of

the consequence ay marry He closes with you thus I know the gentleman I saw him yesterday or tother day Or then or then with such and such and as you say There was he gaming there oertook ins rouse There falling out at tennis or perchance I saw him enter such a house of sale Videlicet a brothel or so forth See you now Your bait of falsehood takes this carp of truth And thus do we of wisdom and

Exit Reynaldo   Enter Ophelia  How now Ophelia whats the matter  OPHELIA Alas my lord I have been so affrighted  POLONIUS With what in the name of God  OPHELIA My lord as I was sewing in my chamber Lord Hamlet with his doublet all unbracd No hat upon his head his stockings fould Ungartred and downgyved to his ankle Pale as his shirt his knees knocking each other And with a look so piteous in purport As if he had been loosed out of hell To speak of horrors he comes before me  POLONIUS Mad for thy love  OPHELIA My lord I do not know but truly I do fear it  POLONIUS What said he  OPHELIA He took me by the wrist and held me hard Then goes he to the length of all his arm And with his other hand thus oer his brow He falls to such perusal of my face As he would draw it Long stayd he so At lasta little shaking of mine arm And thrice his head thus waving up and down He raisd a sigh so piteous and profound As it did seem to shatter all his bulk And end his being That done he lets me go And with his head over his shoulder turnd He seemd to find his way without his eyes For out o doors he went without their help And to the last bended their light on me  POLONIUS Come go with me I will go seek the King This is the very ecstasy of love Whose violent property fordoes itself And leads the will to desperate undertakings As oft as any passion under heaven That does afflict our natures I am sorry What have you given him any hard words of late  OPHELIA No my good lord but as you did command I did repel his letters and denied His access to me  POLONIUS That hath made him mad I am sorry that with better heed and judgment I had not quoted him I feard he did but trifle And meant to wreck thee But beshrew my jealousy It seems it is as proper to our age To cast beyond ourselves in our opinions As it is common for the younger sort To lack discretion Come go we to the King This must be known which being kept close might move More grief to hide than hate to utter love   Exeunt  SCENE II A room in the Castle   Enter King Queen Rosencrantz Guildenstern and Attendants  KING Welcome dear Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Moreover that we much did long to see you The need we have to use you did provoke Our hasty sending Something have you heard Of Hamlets transformation so I call it Since nor thexterior nor the inward man Resembles that it was What it should be More than his fathers death that thus hath put him So much from thunderstanding of himself I cannot dream of I entreat you both That being of so young days brought up with him And since so neighbourd to his youth and humour That you vouchsafe your rest here in our court Some little time so by your companies To draw him on to pleasures and to gather So much as from occasion you may glean Whether aught to us unknown afflicts him thus That opend lies within our remedy  QUEEN Good gentlemen he hath much talkd of you And sure I am two men there are not living To whom he more adheres If it will please you To show us so much gentry and good will As to expend your time with us awhile For the supply and profit of our hope Your visitation shall receive such thanks As fits a kings remembrance  ROSENCRANTZ Both your majesties Might by the sovereign power you have of us Put your dread pleasures more into command Than to entreaty  GUILDENSTERN We both obey And here give up ourselves in the full bent To lay our service freely at your feet To be commanded  KING Thanks Rosencrantz and gentle Guildenstern  QUEEN Thanks Guildenstern and gentle Rosencrantz And I beseech you instantly to visit My too much changed son Go some of you And bring these gentlemen where Hamlet is  GUILDENSTERN Heavens make our presence and our practices Pleasant and helpful to him  QUEEN Ay amen   Exeunt Rosencrantz Guildenstern and

liege I hold my duty as I hold my soul Both to my God and to my gracious King And I do thinkor else this brain of mine Hunts not the trail of policy so sure As it hath usd to dothat I have found The very cause of Hamlets lunacy  KING O speak of that that do I long to hear  POLONIUS Give first admittance to thambassadors My news shall be the fruit to that great feast  KING Thyself do grace to them and bring them in   Exit Polonius  He tells me my sweet queen that he hath found The head and source of all your sons distemper  QUEEN I doubt it is no other but the main His fathers death and our oerhasty marriage  KING Well we shall sift him   Enter Polonius with Voltemand and Cornelius  Welcome my good friends Say Voltemand what from our brother Norway  VOLTEMAND Most fair return of greetings and desires Upon our first he sent out to suppress His nephews levies which to him appeard To be a preparation gainst the Polack But better lookd into he truly found It was against your Highness whereat grievd That so his sickness age and impotence Was falsely borne in hand sends out arrests On Fortinbras which he in brief obeys Receives rebuke from Norway and in fine Makes vow before his uncle never more To give thassay of arms against your Majesty Whereon old Norway overcome with joy Gives him three thousand crowns in annual fee And his commission to employ those soldiers So levied as before against the Polack With an entreaty herein further shown Gives a paper That it might please you to give quiet pass Through your dominions for this enterprise On such regards of safety and allowance As therein are set down  KING It likes us well And at our more considerd time well read Answer and think upon this business Meantime we thank you for your welltook labour Go to your rest at night well feast together Most welcome home   Exeunt Voltemand and Cornelius  POLONIUS This business is well ended My liege and madam to expostulate What majesty should be what duty is Why day is day night night and time is time Were nothing but to waste night day and time Therefore since brevity is the soul of wit And tediousness the limbs and outward flourishes I will be brief Your noble son is mad Mad call I it for to define true madness What ist but to be nothing else but mad But let that go  QUEEN More matter with less art  POLONIUS Madam I swear I use no art at all That he is mad tis true tis true tis pity And pity tis tis true A foolish figure But farewell it for I will use no art Mad let us grant him then And now remains That we find out the cause of this effect Or rather say the cause of this defect For this effect defective comes by cause Thus it remains and the remainder thus Perpend I have a daughterhave whilst she is mine Who in her duty and obedience mark Hath given me this Now gather and surmise Reads To the celestial and my souls idol the most beautified Ophelia Thats an ill phrase a vile phrase beautified is a vile phrase but you shall hear Reads these in her excellent white bosom these c  QUEEN Came this from Hamlet to her  POLONIUS Good madam stay awhile I will be faithful Reads   Doubt thou the stars are fire      Doubt that the sun doth move    Doubt truth to be a liar      But never doubt I love O dear Ophelia I am ill at these numbers I have not art to reckon my groans But that I love thee best O most best believe it Adieu   Thine evermore most dear lady whilst this machine is to him      HAMLET This in obedience hath my daughter showd me And more above hath his solicitings As they fell out by time by means and place All given to mine ear  KING But how hath she receivd his love  POLONIUS What do you think of me  KING As of a man faithful and honourable  POLONIUS I would fain prove so But what might you think When I had seen this hot love on the wing As I perceivd it I must tell you that Before my daughter told me what might you Or my dear Majesty your queen here think If I had playd the desk or tablebook Or given my heart a winking mute and dumb Or lookd upon this love with idle sight What might you think No I went round to work And my young mistress thus I did bespeak Lord Hamlet is a prince out of thy star This must not be And then I precepts gave her That she should lock herself from his resort Admit no messengers receive no tokens Which done she took the fruits of my advice And he repulseda short tale to make Fell into a sadness then into a fast Thence to a watch thence into a weakness Thence to a lightness and by this declension Into the madness wherein now he raves And all we wail for  KING Do you think tis this  QUEEN It may be very likely  POLONIUS Hath there been such a time Id fain know that That I have positively said Tis so When it provd otherwise  KING Not that I know  POLONIUS Take this from this if this be otherwise Points to his head and shoulder If circumstances lead me I will find Where truth is hid though it were hid indeed Within the centre  KING How may we try it further  POLONIUS You know sometimes he walks four hours together Here in the lobby  QUEEN So he does indeed  POLONIUS At such a time Ill loose my daughter to him Be you and I behind an arras then Mark the encounter If he love her not And be not from his reason falln thereon Let me be no assistant for a state But keep a farm and carters  KING We will try it   Enter Hamlet reading  QUEEN But look where sadly the poor wretch comes reading  POLONIUS Away I do beseech you both away Ill board him presently O give me leave   Exeunt King Queen and Attendants  How does my good Lord Hamlet  HAMLET Well Godamercy  POLONIUS Do you know me my lord  HAMLET Excellent well Youre a fishmonger  POLONIUS Not I my lord  HAMLET Then I would you were so honest a man  POLONIUS Honest my lord  HAMLET Ay sir to be honest as this world goes is to be one man picked out of ten thousand  POLONIUS Thats very true my lord  HAMLET For if the sun breed maggots in a dead dog being a good kissing carrion Have you a daughter  POLONIUS I have my lord  HAMLET Let her not walk i th sun Conception is a blessing but not as your daughter may conceive Friend look tot  POLONIUS How say you by that Aside Still harping on my daughter Yet he knew me not at first he said I was a fishmonger He is far gone far gone And truly in my youth I suffered much extremity for love very near this Ill speak to him againWhat do you read my lord  HAMLET Words words words  POLONIUS What is the matter my lord  HAMLET Between who  POLONIUS I mean the matter that you read my lord  HAMLET Slanders sir For the satirical slave says here that old men have grey beards that their faces are wrinkled their eyes purging thick amber and plumtree gum and that they have a plentiful lack of wit together with most weak hams All which sir though I most powerfully and potently believe yet I hold it not honesty to have it thus set down For you yourself sir should be old as I am if like a crab you could go backward  POLONIUS Aside Though this be madness yet there is a method int Will you walk out of the air my lord  HAMLET Into my grave  POLONIUS Indeed that is out o the air Aside How pregnant sometimes his replies are A happiness that often madness hits on which reason and sanity could not so prosperously be delivered of I will leave him and suddenly contrive the means of meeting between him and my daughter My honourable lord I will most humbly take my leave of you  HAMLET You cannot sir take from me anything that I will more willingly part withal except my life except my life except my life  POLONIUS Fare you well my lord  HAMLET These tedious old fools   Enter Rosencrantz and Guildenstern  POLONIUS You go to seek the Lord Hamlet there he is  ROSENCRANTZ To Polonius God save you sir   Exit Polonius  GUILDENSTERN My honoured lord  ROSENCRANTZ My most dear lord  HAMLET My excellent good friends How dost thou Guildenstern Ah Rosencrantz Good lads how do ye both  ROSENCRANTZ As the indifferent children of the earth  GUILDENSTERN Happy in that we are not overhappy On Fortunes cap we are not the very button  HAMLET Nor the soles of her shoe  ROSENCRANTZ Neither my lord  HAMLET Then you live about her waist or in the middle of her favours  GUILDENSTERN Faith her privates we  HAMLET In the secret parts of Fortune O most true she is a strumpet Whats the news  ROSENCRANTZ None my lord but that the worlds grown honest  HAMLET Then is doomsday near But your news is not true Let me question more in particular What have you my good friends deserved at the hands of Fortune that she sends you to prison hither  GUILDENSTERN Prison my lord  HAMLET Denmarks a prison  ROSENCRANTZ Then is the world one  HAMLET A goodly one in which there are many confines wards and dungeons Denmark being one o th worst  ROSENCRANTZ We think not so my lord  HAMLET Why then tis none to you for there is nothing either good or bad but thinking makes it so To me it is a prison  ROSENCRANTZ Why then your ambition makes it one tis too narrow for your mind  HAMLET O God I could be bounded in a nutshell and count myself a king of infinite space were it not that I have bad dreams  GUILDENSTERN Which dreams indeed are ambition for the very substance of the ambitious is merely the shadow of a dream  HAMLET A dream itself is but a shadow  ROSENCRANTZ Truly and I hold ambition of so airy and light a quality that it is but a shadows shadow  HAMLET Then are our beggars bodies and our monarchs and outstretchd heroes the beggars shadows Shall we to th court For by my fay I cannot reason  ROSENCRANTZ and GUILDENSTERN Well wait upon you  HAMLET No such matter I will not sort you with the rest of my servants for to speak to you like an honest man I am most dreadfully attended But in the beaten way of friendship what make you at Elsinore  ROSENCRANTZ To visit you my lord no other occasion  HAMLET Beggar that I am I am even poor in thanks but I thank you And sure dear friends my thanks are too dear a halfpenny Were you not sent for Is it your own inclining Is it a free visitation Come deal justly with me Come come nay speak  GUILDENSTERN What should we say my lord  HAMLET Why anything But to the purpose You were sent for and there is a kind of confession in your looks which your modesties have not craft enough to colour I know the good King and Queen have sent for you  ROSENCRANTZ To what end my lord  HAMLET That you must teach me But let me conjure you by the rights of our fellowship by the consonancy of our youth by the obligation of our everpreserved love and by what more dear a better proposer could charge you withal be even and direct with me whether you were sent for or no  ROSENCRANTZ To Guildenstern What say you  HAMLET Aside Nay then I have an eye of you If you love me hold not off  GUILDENSTERN My lord we were sent for  HAMLET I will tell you why so shall my anticipation prevent your discovery and your secrecy to the King and Queen moult no feather I have of late but wherefore I know not lost all my mirth forgone all custom of exercises and indeed it goes so heavily with my disposition that this goodly frame the earth seems to me a sterile promontory this most excellent canopy the air look you this brave oerhanging firmament this majestical roof fretted with golden fire why it appears no other thing to me than a foul and pestilent congregation of vapours What a piece of work is man How noble in reason How infinite in faculties in form and moving how express and admirable In action how like an angel In apprehension how like a god The beauty of the world the paragon of animals And yet to me what is this quintessence of dust Man delights not me no nor woman neither though by your smiling you seem to say so  ROSENCRANTZ My lord there was no such stuff in my thoughts  HAMLET Why did you laugh then when I said Man delights not me  ROSENCRANTZ To think my lord if you delight not in man what Lenten entertainment the players shall receive from you We coted them on the way and hither are they coming to offer you service  HAMLET He that plays the king shall be welcomehis Majesty shall have tribute of me the adventurous knight shall use his foil and target the lover shall not sigh gratis the humorous man shall end his part in peace the clown shall make those laugh whose lungs are tickle a th sere and the lady shall say her mind freely or the blank verse shall halt fort What players are they  ROSENCRANTZ Even those you were wont to take such delight inthe tragedians of the city  HAMLET How chances it they travel Their residence both in reputation and profit was better both ways  ROSENCRANTZ I think their inhibition comes by the means of the late innovation  HAMLET Do they hold the same estimation they did when I was in the city Are they so followed  ROSENCRANTZ No indeed they are not  HAMLET How comes it Do they grow rusty  ROSENCRANTZ Nay their endeavour keeps in the wonted pace but there is sir an ayry of children little eyases that cry out on the top of question and are most tyrannically clapped fort These are now the fashion and so berattle the common stagesso they call themthat many wearing rapiers are afraid of goosequills and dare scarce come thither  HAMLET What are they children Who maintains em How are they escoted Will they pursue the quality no longer than they can sing Will they not say afterwards if they should grow themselves to common playersas it is most like if their means are no bettertheir writers do them wrong to make them exclaim against their own succession  ROSENCRANTZ Faith there has been much to do on both sides and the nation holds it no sin to tarre them to controversy There was for a while no money bid for argument unless the poet and the player went to cuffs in the question  HAMLET Ist possible  GUILDENSTERN O there has been much throwing about of brains  HAMLET Do the boys carry it away  ROSENCRANTZ Ay that they do my lord Hercules and his load too  HAMLET It is not very strange for my uncle is King of Denmark and those that would make mouths at him while my father lived give twenty forty fifty a hundred ducats apiece for his picture in little Sblood there is something in this more than natural if philosophy could find it out   Flourish of trumpets within  GUILDENSTERN There are the players  HAMLET Gentlemen you are welcome to Elsinore Your hands come The appurtenance of welcome is fashion and ceremony Let me comply with you in this garb lest my extent to the players which I tell you must show fairly outward should more appear like entertainment than yours You are welcome But my unclefather and auntmother are deceived  GUILDENSTERN In what my dear lord  HAMLET I am but mad northnorthwest When the wind is southerly I know a hawk from a handsaw   Enter Polonius  POLONIUS Well be with you gentlemen  HAMLET Hark you Guildenstern and you too at each ear a hearer That great baby you see there is not yet out of his swaddling clouts  ROSENCRANTZ Happily hes the second time come to them for they say an old man is twice a child  HAMLET I will prophesy he comes to tell me of the players Mark itYou say right sir for a Monday morning twas so indeed  POLONIUS My lord I have news to tell you  HAMLET My lord I have news to tell you When Roscius was an actor in Rome  POLONIUS The actors are come hither my lord  HAMLET Buzz buzz  POLONIUS Upon my honour  HAMLET Then came each actor on his ass  POLONIUS The best actors in the world either for tragedy comedy history pastoral pastoralcomical historicalpastoral tragicalhistorical tragicalcomicalhistoricalpastoral scene individable or poem unlimited Seneca cannot be too heavy nor Plautus too light for the law of writ and the liberty These are the only men  HAMLET O Jephthah judge of Israel what a treasure hadst thou  POLONIUS What treasure had he my lord  HAMLET Why    One fair daughter and no more    The which he loved passing well  POLONIUS Aside Still on my daughter  HAMLET Am I not i th right old Jephthah  POLONIUS If you call me Jephthah my lord I have a daughter that I love passing well  HAMLET Nay that follows not  POLONIUS What follows then my lord  HAMLET Why    As by lot God wot and then you know    It came to pass as most like it was The first row of the pious chanson will show you more For look where my abridgement comes   Enter four or five Players  You are welcome masters welcome all I am glad to see thee well Welcome good friends O my old friend Thy face is valancd since I saw thee last Comst thou to beard me in Denmark What my young lady and mistress Byr lady your ladyship is nearer to heaven than when I saw you last by the altitude of a chopine Pray God your voice like a piece of uncurrent gold be not cracked within the ring Masters you are all welcome Well een tot like French falconers fly at anything we see Well have a speech straight Come give us a taste of your quality Come a passionate speech  FIRST PLAYER What speech my lord  HAMLET I heard thee speak me a speech once but it was never acted or if it was not above once for the play I remember pleased not the million twas caviare to the general But it wasas I received it and others whose judgments in such matters cried in the top of minean excellent play well digested in the scenes set down with as much modesty as cunning I remember one said there were no sallets in the lines to make the matter savoury nor no matter in the phrase that might indite the author of affectation but called it an honest method as wholesome as sweet and by very much more handsome than fine One speech in it I chiefly loved Twas Aeneas tale to Dido and thereabout of it especially where he speaks of Priams slaughter If it live in your memory begin at this line let me see let me see    The rugged Pyrrhus like th Hyrcanian beast It is not so it begins with Pyrrhus    The rugged Pyrrhus he whose sable arms    Black as his purpose did the night resemble    When he lay couched in the ominous horse    Hath now this dread and black complexion smeard    With heraldry more dismal Head to foot    Now is he total gules horridly trickd    With blood of fathers mothers daughters sons    Bakd and impasted with the parching streets    That lend a tyrannous and a damned light    To their vile murders Roasted in wrath and fire    And thus oersized with coagulate gore    With eyes like carbuncles the hellish Pyrrhus    Old grandsire Priam seeks So proceed you  POLONIUS Fore God my lord well spoken with good accent and good discretion  FIRST PLAYER    Anon he finds him    Striking too short at Greeks His antique sword    Rebellious to his arm lies where it falls    Repugnant to command Unequal matchd    Pyrrhus at Priam drives in rage strikes wide    But with the whiff and wind of his fell sword    Thunnerved father falls Then senseless Ilium    Seeming to feel this blow with flaming top    Stoops to his base and with a hideous crash    Takes prisoner Pyrrhus ear For lo his sword    Which was declining on the milky head    Of reverend Priam seemd i thair to stick    So as a painted tyrant Pyrrhus stood    And like a neutral to his will and matter    Did nothing    But as we often see against some storm    A silence in the heavens the rack stand still    The bold winds speechless and the orb below    As hush as death anon the dreadful thunder    Doth rend the region so after Pyrrhus pause    Aroused vengeance sets him new awork    And never did the Cyclops hammers fall    On Marss armour forgd for proof eterne    With less remorse than Pyrrhus bleeding sword    Now falls on Priam    Out out thou strumpet Fortune All you gods    In general synod take away her power    Break all the spokes and fellies from her wheel    And bowl the round nave down the hill of heaven    As low as to the fiends  POLONIUS This is too long  HAMLET It shall to the barbers with your beardPrythee say on Hes for a jig or a tale of bawdry or he sleeps Say on come to Hecuba  FIRST PLAYER    But who O who had seen the mobled queen  HAMLET The mobled queen  POLONIUS Thats good Mobled queen is good  FIRST PLAYER    Run barefoot up and down threatning the flames    With bisson rheum A clout upon that head    Where late the diadem stood and for a robe    About her lank and all oerteemed loins    A blanket in thalarm of fear caught up    Who this had seen with tongue in venom steepd    Gainst Fortunes state would treason have pronouncd    But if the gods themselves did see her then    When she saw Pyrrhus make malicious sport    In mincing with his sword her husbands limbs    The instant burst of clamour that she made    Unless things mortal move them not at all    Would have made milch the burning eyes of heaven    And passion in the gods  POLONIUS Look where he has not turnd his colour and has tears ins eyes Pray you no more  HAMLET Tis well Ill have thee speak out the rest of this soonGood my lord will you see the players well bestowed Do you hear let them be well used for they are the abstracts and brief chronicles of the time After your death you were better have a bad epitaph than their ill report while you live  POLONIUS My lord I will use them according to their desert  HAMLET Gods bodikin man better Use every man after his desert and who should scape whipping Use them after your own honour and dignity The less they deserve the more merit is in your bounty Take them in  POLONIUS Come sirs  HAMLET Follow him friends Well hear a play tomorrow   Exeunt Polonius with all the Players but the First  Dost thou hear me old friend Can you play The Murder of Gonzago  FIRST PLAYER Ay my lord  HAMLET Well hat tomorrow night You could for a need study a speech of some dozen or sixteen lines which I would set down and insert int could you not  FIRST PLAYER Ay my lord  HAMLET Very well Follow that lord and look you mock him not   Exit First Player  To Rosencrantz and Guildenstern My good friends Ill leave you till night You are welcome to Elsinore  ROSENCRANTZ Good my lord   Exeunt Rosencrantz and Guildenstern  HAMLET Ay so God b wi ye Now I am alone O what a rogue and peasant slave am I Is it not monstrous that this player here But in a fiction in a dream of passion Could force his soul so to his own conceit That from her working all his visage wand Tears in his eyes distraction ins aspect A broken voice and his whole function suiting With forms to his conceit And all for nothing For Hecuba Whats Hecuba to him or he to Hecuba That he should weep for her What would he do Had he the motive and the cue for passion That I have He would drown the stage with tears And cleave the general ear with horrid speech Make mad the guilty and appal the free Confound the ignorant and amaze indeed The very faculties of eyes and ears Yet I A dull and muddymettled rascal peak Like Johnadreams unpregnant of my cause And can say nothing No not for a king Upon whose property and most dear life A damnd defeat was made Am I a coward Who calls me villain breaks my pate across Plucks off my beard and blows it in my face Tweaks me by the nose gives me the lie i th throat As deep as to the lungs Who does me this Ha Swounds I should take it for it cannot be But I am pigeonliverd and lack gall To make oppression bitter or ere this I should have fatted all the region kites With this slaves offal Bloody bawdy villain Remorseless treacherous lecherous kindless villain Oh vengeance Why what an ass am I This is most brave That I the son of a dear father murderd Prompted to my revenge by heaven and hell Must like a whore unpack my heart with words And fall acursing like a very drab A scullion Fie upont Foh About my brain I have heard That guilty creatures sitting at a play Have by the very cunning of the scene Been struck so to the soul that presently They have proclaimd their malefactions For murder though it have no tongue will speak With most miraculous organ Ill have these players Play something like the murder of my father Before mine uncle Ill observe his looks Ill tent him to the quick If he but blench I know my course The spirit that I have seen May be the devil and the devil hath power Tassume a pleasing shape yea and perhaps Out of my weakness and my melancholy As he is very potent with such spirits Abuses me to damn me Ill have grounds More relative than this The plays the thing Wherein Ill catch the conscience of the King   Exit    ACT III  SCENE I A room in the Castle   Enter King Queen Polonius Ophelia Rosencrantz and Guildenstern  KING And can you by no drift of circumstance Get from him why he puts on this confusion Grating so harshly all his days of quiet With turbulent and dangerous lunacy  ROSENCRANTZ He does confess he feels himself distracted But from what cause he will by no means speak  GUILDENSTERN Nor do we find him forward to be sounded But with a crafty madness keeps aloof When we would bring him on to some confession Of his true state  QUEEN Did he receive you well  ROSENCRANTZ Most like a gentleman  GUILDENSTERN But with much forcing of his disposition  ROSENCRANTZ Niggard of question but of our demands Most free in his reply  QUEEN Did you assay him to any pastime  ROSENCRANTZ Madam it so fell out that certain players We oerraught on the way Of these we told him And there did seem in him a kind of joy To hear of it They are about the court And as I think they have already order This night to play before him  POLONIUS Tis most true And he beseechd me to entreat your Majesties To hear and see the matter  KING With all my heart and it doth much content me To hear him so inclind Good gentlemen give him a further edge And drive his purpose on to these delights  ROSENCRANTZ We shall my lord   Exeunt Rosencrantz and Guildenstern  KING Sweet Gertrude leave us too For we have closely sent for Hamlet hither That he as twere by accident may here Affront Ophelia Her father and myself lawful espials Will so bestow ourselves that seeing unseen We may of their encounter frankly judge And gather by him as he is behavd Ift be thaffliction of his love or no That thus he suffers for  QUEEN I shall obey you And for your part Ophelia I do wish That your good beauties be the happy cause Of Hamlets wildness so shall I hope your virtues Will bring him to his wonted way again To both your honours  OPHELIA Madam I wish it may   Exit Queen  POLONIUS Ophelia walk you hereGracious so please you We will bestow ourselvesTo Ophelia Read on this book That show of such an exercise may colour Your lonelinessWe are oft to blame in this Tis too much provd that with devotions visage And pious action we do sugar oer The devil himself  KING Aside O tis too true How smart a lash that speech doth give my conscience The harlots cheek beautied with plastering art Is not more ugly to the thing that helps it Than is my deed to my most painted word O heavy burden  POLONIUS I hear him coming Lets withdraw my lord   Exeunt King and Polonius   Enter Hamlet  HAMLET To be or not to be that is the question Whether tis nobler in the mind to suffer The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune Or to take arms against a sea of troubles And by opposing end them To dieto sleep No more and by a sleep to say we end The heartache and the thousand natural shocks That flesh is heir to tis a consummation Devoutly to be wishd To die to sleep To sleep perchance to dreamay theres the rub For in that sleep of death what dreams may come When we have shuffled off this mortal coil Must give us pause Theres the respect That makes calamity of so long life For who would bear the whips and scorns of time The oppressors wrong the proud mans contumely The pangs of disprizd love the laws delay The insolence of office and the spurns That patient merit of the unworthy takes When he himself might his quietus make With a bare bodkin Who would these fardels bear To grunt and sweat under a weary life But that the dread of something after death The undiscoverd country from whose bourn No traveller returns puzzles the will And makes us rather bear those ills we have Than fly to others that we know not of Thus conscience does make cowards of us all And thus the native hue of resolution Is sicklied oer with the pale cast of thought And enterprises of great pith and moment With this regard their currents turn awry And lose the name of action Soft you now The fair Ophelia Nymph in thy orisons Be all my sins rememberd  OPHELIA Good my lord How does your honour for this many a day  HAMLET I humbly thank you well well well  OPHELIA My lord I have remembrances of yours That I have longed long to redeliver I pray you now receive them  HAMLET No not I I never gave you aught  OPHELIA My honourd lord you know right well you did And with them words of so sweet breath composd As made the things more rich their perfume lost Take these again for to the noble mind Rich gifts wax poor when givers prove unkind There my lord  HAMLET Ha ha Are you honest  OPHELIA My lord  HAMLET Are you fair  OPHELIA What means your lordship  HAMLET That if you be honest and fair your honesty should admit no discourse to your beauty  OPHELIA Could beauty my lord have better commerce than with honesty  HAMLET Ay truly for the power of beauty will sooner transform honesty from what it is to a bawd than the force of honesty can translate beauty into his likeness This was sometime a paradox but now the time gives it proof I did love you once  OPHELIA Indeed my lord you made me believe so  HAMLET You should not have believed me for virtue cannot so inoculate our old stock but we shall relish of it I loved you not  OPHELIA I was the more deceived  HAMLET Get thee to a nunnery Why wouldst thou be a breeder of sinners I am myself indifferent honest but yet I could accuse me of such things that it were better my mother had not borne me I am very proud revengeful ambitious with more offences at my beck than I have thoughts to put them in imagination to give them shape or time to act them in What should such fellows as I do crawling between earth and heaven We are arrant knaves all believe none of us Go thy ways to a nunnery Wheres your father  OPHELIA At home my lord  HAMLET Let the doors be shut upon him that he may play the fool nowhere but ins own house Farewell  OPHELIA O help him you sweet heavens  HAMLET If thou dost marry Ill give thee this plague for thy dowry Be thou as chaste as ice as pure as snow thou shalt not escape calumny Get thee to a nunnery go farewell Or if thou wilt needs marry marry a fool for wise men know well enough what monsters you make of them To a nunnery go and quickly too Farewell  OPHELIA O heavenly powers restore him  HAMLET I have heard of your paintings too well enough God hath given you one face and you make yourselves another You jig you amble and you lisp and nickname Gods creatures and make your wantonness your ignorance Go to Ill no more ont it hath made me mad I say we will have no more marriages Those that are married already all but one shall live the rest shall keep as they are To a nunnery go   Exit  OPHELIA O what a noble mind is here oerthrown The courtiers soldiers scholars eye tongue sword Thexpectancy and rose of the fair state The glass of fashion and the mould of form Thobservd of all observers quite quite down And I of ladies most deject and wretched That suckd the honey of his music vows Now see that noble and most sovereign reason Like sweet bells jangled out of tune and harsh That unmatchd form and feature of blown youth Blasted with ecstasy O woe is me Thave seen what I have seen see what I see   Enter King and Polonius  KING Love His affections do not that way tend Nor what he spake though it lackd form a little Was not like madness Theres something in his soul Oer which his melancholy sits on brood And I do doubt the hatch and the disclose Will be some danger which for to prevent I have in quick determination Thus set it down he shall with speed to England For the demand of our neglected tribute Haply the seas and countries different With variable objects shall expel This something settled matter in his heart Whereon his brains still beating puts him thus From fashion of himself What think you ont  POLONIUS It shall do well But yet do I believe The origin and commencement of his grief Sprung from neglected love How now Ophelia You need not tell us what Lord Hamlet said We heard it all My lord do as you please But if you hold it fit after the play Let his queen mother all alone entreat him To show his grief let her be round with him And Ill be placd so please you in the ear Of all their conference If she find him not To England send him or confine him where Your wisdom best shall think  KING It shall be so Madness in great ones must not unwatchd go   Exeunt  SCENE II A hall in the Castle   Enter Hamlet and certain Players  HAMLET Speak the speech I pray you as I pronounced it to you trippingly on the tongue But if you mouth it as many of your players do I had as lief the towncrier spoke my lines Nor do not saw the air too much with your hand thus but use all gently for in the very torrent tempest and as I may say whirlwind of passion you must acquire and beget a temperance that may give it smoothness O it offends me to the soul to hear a robustious periwigpated fellow tear a passion to tatters to very rags to split the ears of the groundlings who for the most part are capable of nothing but inexplicable dumb shows and noise I would have such a fellow whipped for oerdoing Termagant It outHerods Herod Pray you avoid it  FIRST PLAYER I warrant your honour  HAMLET Be not too tame neither but let your own discretion be your tutor Suit the action to the word the word to the action with this special observance that you oerstep not the modesty of nature for anything so overdone is from the purpose of playing whose end both at the first and now was and is to hold as twere the mirror up to nature to show virtue her own feature scorn her own image and the very age and body of the time his form and pressure Now this overdone or come tardy off though it make the unskilful laugh cannot but make the judicious grieve the censure of the which one must in your allowance oerweigh a whole theatre of others O there be players that I have seen playand heard others praise and that highlynot to speak it profanely that neither having the accent of Christians nor the gait of Christian pagan nor man have so strutted and bellowed that I have thought some of Natures journeymen had made men and not made them well they imitated humanity so abominably  FIRST PLAYER I hope we have reformd that indifferently with us sir  HAMLET O reform it altogether And let those that play your clowns speak no more than is set down for them For there be of them that will themselves laugh to set on some quantity of barren spectators to laugh too though in the meantime some necessary question of the play be then to be considered Thats villanous and shows a most pitiful ambition in the fool that uses it Go make you ready   Exeunt Players   Enter Polonius Rosencrantz and Guildenstern  How now my lord Will the King hear this piece of work  POLONIUS And the Queen too and that presently  HAMLET Bid the players make haste   Exit Polonius  Will you two help to hasten them  ROSENCRANTZ and GUILDENSTERN We will my lord   Exeunt Rosencrantz and Guildenstern  HAMLET What ho Horatio   Enter Horatio  HORATIO Here sweet lord at your service  HAMLET Horatio thou art een as just a man As eer my conversation copd withal  HORATIO O my dear lord  HAMLET '"
